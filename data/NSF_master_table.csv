The beam consists of the same kind of particles that comprise ordinary light, called photons, except that their wavelength is ten billion times shorter than that of visible light.  Such short wavelengths enable researchers to look into the interior of the nucleus and search for new kinds of nuclear particles that are believed to exist in the nuclear environment.  The short-wavelength light beam is produced by passing a beam of electrons from a particle accelerator through a diamond crystal.  If the diamond crystal is sufficiently perfect then the short-wavelength light it produces is polarized when it emerges from the crystal.  The polarization gives experimenters enhanced selectivity in the search for new particles inside the nucleus.  A team of physicists residing at Jefferson Lab and about a dozen universities, including both US and foreign partners, are responsible for the design and construction of both the photon beam and the experimental apparatus that uses it, and is known collectively as the GlueX Collaboration.  In order to achieve the desired beam intensity and polarization for the GlueX experiment, the Connecticut group faces a challenge in fabricating and mounting diamonds with the required shape and quality.  Taking advantage of recent advances in diamond crystal growth within the gem industry, and also the excellent diagnostic tools available at the Cornell CHESS X-ray source, the group seeks to produce ultra-thin diamond crystals of large area and mount them in such a way that they are stable when exposed to an intense electron beam from the accelerator.  The group is also working together with partners to produce detectors to be used to measure the precise wavelength of each of the photons produced in the crystal, and to monitor the beam polarization during the experiment.  All of this work is carried out by students at the University of Connecticut, under the supervision of the Principal Investigator.  The team includes one graduate student and two or three undergraduate students who are active on the project both during the academic year, and more intensely, during the summer.  One highlight of the group's schedule during the month of July is to welcome 2-4 gifted high school students from the UConn Mentor Connection program to work alongside the group leader and other team members for three weeks on aspects of the project adapted to their level of experience.  These activities amplify the long-term impact of the nuclear physics research program at the University of Connecticut, both in terms of the enriched educational experiences that it provides to students across a broad range of levels, and in the cutting-edge basic science that it produces.

Future  projects include understanding physics opportunities  presented by recent and forthcoming solar neutrino  experiments, exploring the role of neutrinos in supernova  dynamics, investigating consequences of quantum dissipative  tunneling in nuclear reactions, exploring phase transitions  in nuclei with multi-fragmentation, as well as developing  new mathematical techniques to address the physics questions  arising in these studies.  Observed solar neutrino flux is  deficient relative to that predicted by the standard solar  model. Neutrino oscillations in the presence of matter and  magnetic fields were invoked to explain this deficiency.  We  will be studying a new aspect of the neutrino transport in  matter, behavior of neutrino oscillations in stochastic  media.       There has been much progress in our understanding of  supernovae. Explosion models are improved and supernovae  were proposed as a site where heavy elements are created.  Neutrinos have a significant impact on these phenomena.  Dissipative tunneling is especially important for low-energy  fusion reactions.  These reactions are not only of interest  to nuclear astrophysics, but they also provide new insights  into the reaction dynamics and nuclear structure.  Multi-  fragmentation is the statistical emission of fragments from  a nuclear system, which is undergoing expansion under the  influence of thermal pressure and nuclear binding. It is a  probe of dynamics of phase transitions.  The theoretical  research proposed will be done in intensive collaboration  with experimental groups in the U.S. and abroad.

Specific applications of these methods and other techniques will include calculation of (e,e'p) and (e,e'2N) cross sections, construction of an in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction for analysis of heavy-ion reactions, studies of strangeness propagation in nuclear media, quantitative evaluation of the properties of nucleonic superfluids in various pairing channels, elucidation of universal features of P-wave pairing, exploration of the role of exchange-symmetry breaking within an ab initio theory of Bose-Einstein condensation in liquid helium, and statistical prediction of nulear halflives and atomic masses.

Improved nuclear measurements will help clarify some of the  outstanding mysteries that exist in astrophysics.  The  proposed apparatus will consist of a small but highintensity  electrostatic ion accelerator coupled to a specially  designed, high-efficiency magnetic detection device.  The  latter will consist of two large superconducting magnets  which will be designed and built in the U.S. as a  collaborative effort with a U.S. industrial partner.

A unique feature of the facility will be the  production of relatively intense, short-lived unstable  nuclear beams for the study of reactions related to  explosive nucleosynthesis.  The new apparatus will also be  available for new types of applied research in atomic  physics, biophysics and materials science.

The first project will use the recoil-corrected continuum shell model (RSCCM) to investigate nucleon induced reactions on light nuclei, in particular those nucleon capture reactions of astrophysical interest.   The recent extension of this model to p-shell nuclei allows the study of single neutron halo nuclei, polarized electron scattering data, and a variety of other topics including the effective interaction of nuclear structure theory.  The second area of research is in the study of the hyperon-nucleon interaction with meager experimental input from scattering and binding energy systematics of light hypernuclei.  The RCCSM, by allowing the hyperon to be bound or unbound, is particularly suitable for hypernuclear structure calculations because bound state excitation and quasi-free scattering are included in one consistent framework.

The role of force in regulating gene expression is an emerging and uniquely multi-disciplinary area of study. Mechanical force is important during organism development and for proper maintenance of cells and tissues. Specifically, shear stress on endothelial cells alters gene expression and changes cell behavior. There are many known mechanosensors in cells, but short-lived signaling events are not sufficient to explain both the long-time responses and permanent changes of cells. The DNA inside the nucleus, which is organized into the genome, has unique mechanical properties capable of responding proportionally to both the magnitude and duration of applied stress. Nuclear deformation may be important since placement of genes within the nucleus is correlated with their expression. This grant will test the hypothesis that the reorganization of the nucleus helps regulate gene expression in cells exposed to force. Subnuclear reorganization in endothelial cells will be monitored under dose dependent extracellular shear stress using real time particle tracking of fluorescent proteins. Nuclear structural proteins will be up- and down-regulated to determine the role of nuclear mechanics on controlling gene expression and gene movement stimulated by extracellular shear stress. The effects of chemically-stimulated angiogenesis, blood vessel formation, on subnuclear reorganization, gene expression and cellular phenotype will specifically be examined.   By correlating changes in subnuclear rearrangement, gene accessibility and gene expression with changes in nuclear mechanics, the amount of force the DNA experiences in a cell under stress can be determined. The changes associated with modifications of individual nuclear structural proteins bridges the gap between nanoscale structure and microscale mechanics of the nucleus. This project aims to prove a new form of cellular mechanotransduction using a combination of particle tracking, biological manipulation, and gene analysis in cells under shear stress. While this project will answer important biological questions using novel engineering techniques and approaches, it will also show the power of combining biology with engineering.  Changes in gene regulation associated with force, independent of or to enhance chemical factors, will help scientists and engineers to better control cells for a variety of technological applications including areas of tissue engineering and stem cell therapies. Working at the interface of science, engineering and medicine includes many unique ethical situations. Seminars and web-based tutorials promoting ethical conduct in the classroom and good research practices are being developed in collaboration with the Center for Applied Ethics and will be stressed throughout graduate research, undergraduate laboratory and summer research curricula.",,,Kris,N,Dahl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kndahl@andrew.cmu.edu                                                           ,2010,372225,

Most of this work will utilize fast neutrons produced at the University's accelerator facility and the unique gamma-ray and neutron detection capabilities of this laboratory; complementary, collaborative research with colleagues at several other institutions is in progress and these collaborations are expected to continue.  Neutron scattering experiments are primarily oriented toward exploring multiphonon vibrational excitations of the quadrupole and octupole types in nearly spherical nuclei, examining the separate roles of magnetic and electric dipole transitions in collective excitations, defining the roles of protons and neutrons in collective modes, and understanding nuclear shell structure and the nature of nuclear shape transitions.  The characterization of phonon-coupled excitations of mixed-symmetry states, a new type of collective mode, in weakly deformed nuclei will receive a high priority.  A new direction is the use of higher-energy neutrons to produce final nuclei that are not readily accessible with charged-particle fusion-evaporation reactions.  Lifetime determinations with the Doppler-shift attenuation method and gamma-gamma coincidence measurements, for which the methodologies have been developed in our laboratory, will play crucial roles in many of these studies.  Neutron scattering studies, which aid in elucidating the differences between neutron excitation and other probes, will complement studies of the microscopic basis of collective excitations.  Carefully selected studies in other areas, e.g., nuclear astrophysics and the properties of light nuclei, which are particularly appropriate to the capabilities and facilities at the University of Kentucky accelerator laboratory will be pursued.  Education continues to be an important component of all activities in our laboratory, and efforts to provide an excellent working environment for undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate education in nuclear science at the University of Kentucky will be made.

Two complementary microscopic approaches will be pursued:  one is based on explicit descriptions of the correlation structure of the quantum system in space and spin degrees of freedom; the other focuses on the modification in intrinsic properties and interactions experienced by a particle emerged in a many-particle medium.  These powerful computational methods give access to a wide range of systems and phenomena of fundamental interest, including the superfluids and superconductors that exist at superhigh temperatures inside pulsars; the superfluid phase transition in liquid helium near sero temperature; lattice-gauge models that offer insights into the nature of the vacuum and the mechanism of quark confinement; short-distance processes in nuclei and the link between nucleonic theories and quantum chromodynamics; and the rich panorama of excited states of nuclei and strongly coupled electronic systems.  Projected research on these problems will provide theoretical support for existing or planned experimental efforts, including projects at CEBAF and observations of neutron stars by orbiting X-ray observatories.  In a novel interdisciplinary initiative, neural network computational structures will be used for phenomenological analysis of nuclei and of materials of potential technological importance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                !         !

Much of the research will be carried out with the new RESOLUT rare isotope facility at the Florida State University Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory.  This will be directed toward astrophysical studies related to the rapid proton capture process in nucleosynthesis, experimental investigation of the structure of very light nuclei for comparison with forefront ab-initio theoretical calculations, and exploration of how the fundamental shell structure (""magic numbers"") in atomic nuclei changes with large proton or neutron excess.  Closely related, complementary experiments will also be carried out at the National Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory.  The unique FSU polarized lithium beam will also be used to characterize reactions of astrophysical interest.  A new type of motion in highly deformed, rapidly rotating nuclei will be explored with Gammasphere  at the ATLAS facility.  The FSU group constructed a major part of the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and now proposes to study the production of J/PSI particles to test how closely the experiments are able to reproduce the quark-gluon plasma that existed in the earliest times of the Big Bang.  Other members of the FSU group propose to search for new elementary particles whose unique quantum numbers will clearly prove that they involve excitations of the gluons.  Such particles are predicted by the best current models of quarks and gluons, but have not been conclusively seen before.  The experiment will be performed at Jefferson Laboratory, which has already approved it with a high rating.

Almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its tiny nucleus. The atomic nucleus is made of nucleons, which are either positively charged (protons) or electrically neutral (neutrons). These subatomic particles, however, are not elementary but are themselves composite objects made of quarks held together by the strong force via the exchange of glue particles (gluons).  The properties of protons and neutrons are a manifestation of that strongest force on Earth. The present theory of that force is Quantum Chromodynamics.   Our research program at the University of South Carolina is based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. There, we use high-energy electron and photon beams along with sophisticated particle detectors as powerful microscopes to study the subatomic world. We try to answer questions like: What is the structure of the nucleon? What are and how can we excite its internal degrees of freedom? Does the structure of the nucleon change if it is embedded in dense nuclear matter? The experimental study of these properties gives insight into the nature of the strong force and allows for rigorous tests of the underlying theory. Our program provides scientific training to young researchers and also benefits the medical physics community through our understanding of the use of photon and electron beams for radiotherapy.

C*-algebras could be thought as collections of infinite matrices of numbers endowed with an interesting algebraic and topological structure.  The C*-algebras have significant applications to other parts of mathematics (geometry,topology,ergodic theory),to parts of physics (quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics) or to other sciences (the structure of DNA and other molecules).A complete classification (""enumeration"") of a special class of operator algebras,called amenable von Neumann algebras,was given by Connes in his Fields Medal winning work.  This project has two main goals.One is to classify (""enumerate"") large classes of amenable (nuclear) C*-algebras with the ideal property (an interesting technical condition) which are defined by a particular construction (""inductive limits"").The other one is to show that many amenable C*-algebras with the ideal property arising from a completely different and natural construction (""crossed products"") belong in fact to one of the above classes (of ""inductive limits"") that the investigator proposes to classify (""enumerate"").This project could have an important impact in several mathematical fields including operator algebras, dynamical systems,geometry and also in some domains outside mathematics (e.g. in quantum physics).

Nevertheless, a type of myosin, called nuclear myosin I, has been identified in the nucleus. Actin is also abundant in the nucleus. Importantly, it has been established that actin and nuclear myosin I are important in transcription.  However, the details of how these proteins are involved in transcription are not known. Therefore, this project will investigate the proposition that actin is involved in multiple stages of transcription. There are two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will investigate how actin is involved in pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation. PIC formation is the first step in transcription and involves the association of a host of proteins at the promoter region of a gene. Although actin is necessary for PIC formation, when and how it is recruited to the developing PIC, what proteins it associates with and whether it has an enzymatic or structural function in the PIC is not known. These questions are the subject of specific aim 1. Specific aim 2 will investigate the form of actin that is involved in transcription. Actin can exist as a monomer or it can polymerize to form long filaments (F-actin). F-actin is the form of actin involved in muscle contraction. However, actin filaments have never been demonstrated in the nucleus. Therefore, a central question regarding actin in the nucleus is whether nuclear processes require monomeric or filamentous actin. This question will be addressed in specific aim 2. Data from these could potentially change our understanding of transcription, a process that is fundamental to life as we know it.

The research activities will center on understanding the properties of unstable nuclei far from stability, which are essential for understanding the fundamental nuclear force, modeling the formation of heavy elements in supernovae, and testing a wide variety of nuclear theories and models.  In addition, we will be developing novel applications of nuclear physics techniques to questions in other scientific fields, which can lead to valuable new scientific information in these areas.  Involving undergraduate students in all of these efforts educates them, excites them, and gives them tremendous preparation for graduate work.   Specifically the Hope College Nuclear Group currently is planning to characterize the structure of several radioactive nuclei, including 16Be, 13Li, 5H, and 9C.  These studies will be done at the National Superconducting Cyclotron with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA)  and the University of Notre Dame with the ND neutron wall.  At the Hope College Ion Beam Analysis Laboratory, the nuclear group will use nuclear scattering and x-ray spectrometry along with accelerator and detector technology to determine metalloprotein stoichiometry, to characterize the trace-element constituents of glass, and to determine the geological provenance of sand grains. Rutherford backscattering will also be used to characterize electropolymers and conduct in-situ measurements of protein fragments in gels.   Undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the experiments: planning, detector development, experiment setup, data taking, analysis, and dissemination. This grant will also provide support for a postdoctoral associate as part of a trial effort to train future researchers that can effectively involve undergraduate students in the setting of a primarily undergraduate institution. **  ",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Paul,A,DeYoung,Graham,F,Peaslee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,deyoung@hope.edu                                                                ,2007,296871,

Young honey bees work within the hive, but at approximately three weeks of age begin to forage to flowers for pollen and nectar. Changes in the size of individual nerve cells and the volume of entire brain regions result from the shift from in-hive tasks to foraging. This project investigates the role of hormones in promoting brain growth in response to new experiences using the honey bee model. The responses to important developmental hormones of bee neurons growing in culture will be studied using both microscopy and methods that permit gene expression to be measured. These studies will yield an understanding, at a cellular and molecular level, of why nerve cells are more likely to grow during some stages of life than others. This project will provide training in neuroscience research for a graduate student. In addition, the co-PIs will develop a new bioinformatics course for undergraduates.

The starting hypothesis is that scientists  have nurtured a dream for nuclear energy while providing important services in radiation protection at medical facilities. Preliminary research suggests that the scientific and commercial sectors in Ghana have become increasingly embedded and co-dependent.  Through an examination of scientists, community leaders and their relationship with commercial interests, the project will greatly expand our understanding of scientific practice in a post-colonial nation and provide new avenues for nuclear energy policy.   Ghana has witnessed a variety of financial policies since independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, including socialist and neo-liberal regimes. This project will provide important documentation of how scientists have managed to weather economic downturns. Methods include collecting archival materials and conducting interviews with select leaders in business and science engaged in efforts to develop alternative energy sources and monitor radiation at hospitals and clinics. While energy production is a future goal, the study examines how scientists with access to a 30kW miniature neutron source reactor (the GHAAR-1) and Cobalt-60 gamma source currently provide assistance to entrepreneurs in the agricultural and medical sectors.

It functions much like a light interferometer, except that it detects the interference of neutron matter waves rather than light waves. A cold neutron (moving less than 2000 m/s) has an associated quantum wavelength comparable in size to the spacing of atoms in a solid, so it interacts with these atoms coherently, i.e. like a matter wave rather than a particle. When a slow neutron enters the interferometer, its matter wave is diffracted in a perfect silicon crystal and splits into two sub-waves, each taking a different path. The two sub-waves meet again in a another crystal and can interfere with each other. The degree of interference determines the probability of detecting the neutron in a neutron detector placed behind the interferometer. We can place a piece of matter, a magnetic or electric field, or even a gravitational field inside the interferometer to shift the phase of one sub-wave relative to another and change this interference. This gives important and often unique information about the strength and nature of the neutron's interaction in the material or field. We use the neutron interferometer to study phenomena important for nuclear physics, such as the internal charge distribution of the neutron and the scattering of neutrons from light nuclei.  Several graduate and undergraduate students participate in this research program. In addition to learning the science of neutron interferometry, they are educated broadly in the physics and methodology of research at neutron sources, which prepares them for a wide range of careers related to neutron science in academia and industry.

The structure of nuclei produced by fragmentation reactions is investigated using two different approaches. In the first, ground-state magnetic properties of short-lived nuclei that decay by beta-emission are measured using radiation-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (beta-NMR). After production they are implanted in a crystal host located at the center of a high-precision magnet, and their response to alternating magnetic fields is monitored via the directional distribution of their beta-particle emission. In the second approach, properties of ground and excited states of highly neutron-rich nuclei are measured via in-flight breakup reactions, using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), which Westmont students helped construct along with students from 9 other colleges and universities. The energies and trajectories of forward moving neutrons are measured in coincidence with the energies and trajectories of the charged fragments, which are deflected out of the main beam by a sweeper magnet. This research program will help advance knowledge of nuclear structure both near to and far from stability, and provide the type of cutting-edge undergraduate student research experiences that help recruit future generations of nuclear scientists.

In Chlamydomonas, two mechanisms, namely chromatin/nuclear domains and DNA methylation, are hypothesized to be the responsible mechanisms. In order to test these working hypotheses, this project has the following specific aims: 1) To isolate tagged mutants defective in transcription gene silencing, 2) To clone and characterize a tagged gene(s) involved in transcription repression, and 3) To map the chromosomal location of silenced and stable transgenic loci.  The production of transgenic plants and animals is rapidly becoming routine, but the introduced genes are often unstably expressed, leading to the loss or reduced manifestation of newly acquired traits. This phenomenon of transgene silencing often results from a variety of epigenetic mechanisms, operating at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In most cases the underlying molecular processes have not been precisely identified. The results of this work could contribute to a greater understanding of epigenetic phenomena in eukaryotes, since preliminary data suggest that the molecular mechanisms might be evolutionarily conserved. The analysis of epigenetic gene silencing in Chlamydomonas can provide a genetic approach for understanding essential features of chromosomal/nuclear organization controlling gene expression. From a practical perspective, the results could contribute to the development of methods to overcome epigenetic silencing methodology, which could contribute to the generation of transgenic plants and animals.

Similar to the more widely-known magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRS is a powerful method of chemical analysis which allows identification of chemical compounds as well as the detailed study of biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. It is particularly well-suited to detect many different metabolites in biological systems simultaneously. Microfluidic devices are miniaturized chemical laboratories on a chip which allow precise control of very small amounts of liquids in complicated fluidic networks. They enable integration of laboratory procedures into a simple and expandable platform, often with huge improvements in cost, reliability, and throughput. The Utz group seeks to develop an efficient method to extract MRS spectra directly from samples inside microfluidic devices, without the need to transfer liquid from the chip to the MRS spectrometer. To achieve this, magnetic inductive coupling is being used to focus the sensitivity of the spectrometer onto specific fluidic chambers on the chip. This will enable new tools for research as well as medical diagnostics based on the simultaneous detection of a large number of metabolites.  The project is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together microfabrication, electrical engineering, chemistry, and spectroscopy. It provides an ideal learning and training environment for postdoctoral research associates as well as graduate and undergraduate students.

Great progress has been made in solving this problem in the last ten years due to new developments in nuclear many-body theory and advances in computer technology.  One of these developments is the so-called No Core Shell Model (NCSM), in which all the nucleons in a nucleus are treated as being active, instead of only a few valence nucleons outside an assumed inert core.  The NCSM approach simplifies the structure of the many-body problem to be solved and has had considerable success in describing the properties of light nuclei, up to masses near oxygen, i.e., nucleon number 16.  This same NCSM approach can be and is being now applied to nuclear reaction theory.  One of the fundamental advances following from these investigations is the understanding of the importance of not only pair-wise interactions among nucleons in determining nuclear structure, but also of triplet (or three-nucleon) interactions.  More work needs to be done to determine whether or not four-nucleon and higher-nucleon interactions are also necessary.  Another important problem is to understand the relationship between the energy required in the two-nucleon system relative to the energy available for all the nucleons in a nucleus.  Broader Impact: Our NCSM approach not only has wide applications in theoretical nuclear physics but also in atomic and molecular physics and in condensed matter physics, such as, the problem of a small number of fermions, e.g., electrons, constrained by an harmonic oscillator trap.  In addition, our research program is actively educating and mentoring a new generation of young nuclear theorists.  For example, during the previous award period, our research group included two undergraduate students, two graduate students, and three post-doctoral research associates.

It functions much like a light interferometer, except that it detects the interference of neutron matter waves rather than light waves. A cold neutron (moving less than 2000 m/s) has an associated quantum wavelength comparable in size to the spacing of atoms in a solid, so it interacts with these atoms coherently, i.e. like a matter wave rather than a particle. When a slow neutron enters the interferometer, its matter wave is diffracted in a perfect silicon crystal and splits into two sub-waves, each taking a different path. The two sub-waves meet again in a another crystal and can interfere with each other. The degree of interference determines the probability of detecting the neutron in a neutron detector placed behind the interferometer. We can place a piece of matter, a magnetic or electric field, or even a gravitational field inside the interferometer to shift the phase of one sub-wave relative to another and change this interference. This gives important and often unique information about the strength and nature of the neutron's interaction in the material or field. We use the neutron interferometer to study phenomena important for nuclear physics, such as the internal charge distribution of the neutron and the scattering of neutrons from light nuclei.  Several graduate and undergraduate students participate in this research program. In addition to learning the science of neutron interferometry, they are educated broadly in the physics and methodology of research at neutron sources, which prepares them for a wide range of careers related to neutron science in academia and industry.

These initial observations will be fully investigated by using a combination of cell and molecular biological tools to identify the components of nuclear structure that designate an origin of replication.  Specific aims are: 1. To determine if origins of replication are designate at the time of nuclear assembly, 2. To determine if pre-designated origins in Gl nuclei are disrupted by a Xenopus early cleavage mitotic cycle, 3. To determine if the mammalian nuclear membrane is necessary for site-specific initiation of replication in Xenopus egg extracts.  %%%  DNA replication is central to the life cycle of every living organism and, although much is known about the process in simple organisms, the regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes are largely unknown.  DNA replication initiates within defined chromosomal loci in eukaryotic cells but naked DNA in systems derived from metazoan organisms do not have any such requirements. This proposal describes a novel approach based upon the hypothesis that DNA replication in metazoan chromosomes is regulated by aspects of nuclear structure that cannot be easily reconstructed when starting with cloned DNA templates. Cell-free extracts from Xenopus eggs provide an excellent model system in which to test the hypothesis that the structural and functional organization of the nucleus is crucial in regulating DNA replication.  ***  ??",0000099|61,Other Applications NEC|Life Science Biological,David,M,Gilbert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gilbertd@upstate.edu                                                            ,1995,156172,

Thus, as proliferating fibroblasts become quiescent there is a significant decrease in the size of materials that are able to enter the nucleus.  Conversely, nuclear transport capacity increases in rapidly dividing, SV40-transformed cells.  The experiments proposed are designed to investigate nuclear transport during oogenesis in Xenopus laevis.  There are several advantages for using this system to study the regulation of nuclear transport.  First, there is a considerable amount of data, obtained from oocytes, relating to the composition and structure of the pores, as well as the cytoplasmic factors that are required for transport.  Second, since oogenesis is accompanied by a high level of nuclear synthetic activity, these cells are especially useful for studying nuclear transport.  Third, it is possible to correlate nuclear permeability changes with specific changes in RNA synthesis.  In preliminary studies, it was found that there is a size-dependent increase in the nuclear import of colloidal gold particles coated with nucleoplasmin (a Xenopus nuclear protein) as Stage 1 oocytes progress to Stage 2 (early vitellogenesis).  This is accompanied by a shift in RNA production from primarily 5S RNA (during Stage 1) to mainly 18 and 28S rRNA (in Stage 2 cells).  Studies are proposed to further characterize nuclear transport capacity at these stages, and determine: 1, if there are differences in import rates that are independent of substrate size; and 2, if there are corresponding differences in nuclear export.  Transport will be investigated by microinjecting either fluorescent labeled proteins or coated colloidal gold particles into intact cells, and subsequently analyzing the intracellular distribution of the particles.  It has also been established, using permeabilized HeLa cells, that cytosolic extracts obtained from vitellogenic oocytes are more effective in promoting nuclear import than Stage 1  extracts.  There is evidence that this difference is due either to variations in the activity of cytoplasmic translocation factors (rather than binding factors) or to the presence of transport inhibitors (particularly in Stage 1 extracts).  Experiments will be performed to distinguish between these possibilities, and also to determine if known translocation factors (e.g., Ran or p10) are involved in altering transport capacity.        The eukaryotic cell is highly compartmentalized, with various specific cellular functions and metabolic processes localized in one or another compartment.  These functions need to be coordinated and regulated.  The nucleus of the cell is the compartment which contains the genetic material, DNA, and within which all of the DNA-based metabolic functions (replication and transcription) occur.  Those proteins that are involved in these functions are manufactured in the cytoplasm, and must be transported into the nucleus; similarly, the RNA that is transcribed from the genes and serves as the templates for all of protein synthesis must be transported out of the nucleus.   Regulation of nucleocytoplasmic exchange could represent a fundamental mechanism for modulating metabolic processes in cells.

The funds (provided from the Division of International Programs) will be used strictly to promote and facilitate the international component of the research.    Dr. de Lanerolle and his collaborator, Dr. Pavel Hozak in Prague, Czech Republic have already demonstrated the presence of a myosin I like protein in the nucleus.  This protein has an apparent molecular weight of 120,000, it is associated with K+-EDTA ATPase activity, it binds calmodulin, it is photoaffinity labelled with ATP, it binds actin in the absence, but not the presence, of ATP and it is recognized by an antibody to myosin I purified from adrenal glands.  Microsequencing of the 120 kDa protein has positively identified it as a member of the myosin I-beta subfamily of the myosin superfamily of actin based molecular motors.  The microsequencing data was used to clone the cDNA for this protein.  Both methods have demonstrated the presence of a 16 amino acid N-terminal extension that is unique to the 120 kDa protein.  Other data suggest that the unique 16 amino acid extension is responsible for the nuclear localization of nuclear myosin I and that nuclear myosin I associates with RNA polymerase II and is involved in transcription.    Drs. de Lanerolle and Hozak now propose to continue this international collaboration to explore these findings further.  Co-localization and functional assays will be performed in Dr. Hozak's laboratory in Prague, using plasmids, antibodies  and other reagents developed in Dr. de Lanerolle's laboratory in Chicago.  To facilitate this collaboration, Dr. Hozak's students will be trained in molecular biology methods in Dr. De Lanerolle's laboratory and Dr. de Lanerolle's students will be trained in advanced microscopy and microinjection methods and in situ transcription assays in Dr. Hozak's laboratory.

The latter has resulted in a number of new fourth order Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. These new algorithms require knowing the potential and the gradient of the potential. The fourth order error coefficients of these new algorithms are orders of magnitude smaller then those of the existing split operator (second-order) method and can produce converged results using time steps 10-50 times as large. This operator factorization approach suggests a new class of more efficient algorithms for solving diverse quantum many-body and dynamical problems in nuclear, condensed matter and atomic physics.

It has long been recognized that chromatin fibers can exist at varying levels of compaction and that the level has a controlling influence on gene expression.  In the last few years, evidence has accumulated that chromatin is organized into topologically constrained domains that are transcriptionally inert or transcriptionally active.  The domains consist of loops which are attached at their bases to a proteinaceous nuclear scaffold or matrix by DNA sequences called Scaffold Attachment Regions (SARs).  When cloned strong SARs from tobacco are used to flank a reporter gene construct, the SARs cause a 70-fold increase in expression of the reporter gene.  What causes this increase?  One hypothesis is that the flanking SARs allow the incorporated DNA to form its own independent loop domain--a domain free from the influence of the domain into which it was incorporated.  What then determines if such an artificial domain has an active chromatin structure?  The principal investigator will investigate these questions and related phenomena.  He will isolate a number of plant SARs and characterize and scaffold binding properties.  This will allow him to investigate what determines if a DNA sequence will bind to the nuclear scaffold.  His preliminary work has resulted in the discovery of a number of tobacco SARs with varying affinities for the nuclear scaffold.  These SARs will be used to test the hypothesis that SARs with greater affinity for the nuclear scaffold have a greater effect on transcription.  He will also isolate and characterize the specific proteins of the scaffold that are responsible for the binding.  He will investigate properties of the loop domains that may have an effect on the transcriptional activity of the domain.  These experiments are expected to yield valuable information about the chromatin structure of loop domains in plants and to have a practical applicati on in the control of gene expression in transgenic plants.  %%%  In eukaryotic organisms, DNA is organized into a complex nucleic acid-protein structure called chromatin.

Recent developments in accelerators and experimental technology now make it possible to produce thousands of new isotopes and study their physics.  Along this road it will be possible to study what is the origin of the elements of the cosmos, what are the features of nuclear matter with unusual proton-neutron composition, what are sizes, shapes and excitation modes of exotic nuclei. The large discovery potential of nuclear physics in this vast terra incognita was already demonstrated by observation of nuclear halos, new types of radioactivity, superheavy elements and so on. Nuclear theory must meet a great challenge and find a consistent way of describing new phenomena and making reliable predictions for the future.  The proposal is directed toward achieving that goal. We hope to address a few important issues such as the limits of nuclear stability, nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest, the description of loosely bound nuclear systems, new cluster effects, new modes of collective behavior, weak interactions in exotic systems,the coexistence of chaotic and regular dynamics far from the line of nuclear stability.

This work is centered around the NSL facilities, but also utilizes accelerators at other laboratories. The research program emphasizes extensive collaborations with experimental and theoretical physicists at other universities, often involving visits by these scientists and their students in order to use the NSL accelerator facilities. The active areas of research at the NSL include reaction studies with short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, nuclear astrophysics, the study of weak interactions and related fundamental processes, and nuclear structure physics. These four topics span a large fraction of the frontiers of nuclear-physics research, and have a particularly large overlap with other areas of many-body physics. Yet, they are all closely related. For example, radioactive-beam physics is an important issue both for modern nuclear-astrophysics research and for the study of nuclear properties far from the valley of stability, while the properties of the nucleus as a quantal many-body system can and have been exploited to learn more about the laws of physics at the most fundamental level. The NSL is the site of pioneering work in the development of low-energy radioactive nuclear beams, and is an important center for research in nuclear astrophysics. In addition, local research groups in Atomic Physics and Radiation Chemistry carry out interdisciplinary programs using the NSL facilities. Specific topics of current interest in nuclear astrophysics include the production of the elements in steady-state ""nuclear burning"" in main sequence stars, and in violent events such as nova and supernova explosions. The radioactive nuclear beam research is directed at achieving a better understanding of nuclear reaction processes relevant for solar neutrino physics, as well as the structure and reactions of weakly-bound ""halo"" nuclei which appear at the limits of nuclear stability and are believed to have very diffuse surfaces that are rich in either neutron or proton matter. The fundamental-interactions program emphasizes several issues relevant to the search for physics beyond the standard electroweak model of elementary particle physics, including the search for ""scalar currents"" in weak decays and the limits to time-reversal violation in the decay of the neutron. In addition, the weak decays of nuclei relevant for various aspects of solar neutrino physics are being explored. The nuclear structure program involves the study of static and dynamic nuclear phenomena, such as the harmonic and anharmonic vibrations of nuclei, the recently discovered ""magnetic"" and ""anti-magnetic"" rotation phenomena, and the attempt to obtain a more complete description of the structure of ""super-deformed"" nuclei.

Proteins Required for Zygotic Nuclear Fusion                                                                                                                                        ,OCE ,1/9/1992,9023861,Fellowship                                   ,3/15/1991,8/31/1993,84000,Washington University                                           ,0025205000,MO,"ONE BROOKINGS DRIVE, CAMPUS BOX ",SAINT LOUIS               ,63130,US,BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,"                                                                                The long-term objectives of this project are to understand how                  haploid nuclei within a newly formed zygote recognize each                      other as appropriate partners for eventual fusion, how they                     move towards one another, and how the fusion event itself is                    initiated. If any one of the preceding  steps goes awry, the                    zygote can not develop.  The creation of a single diploid                       nucleus within the zygote eliminates the last barriers to an                    intermingling of the chromosomes from two different organisms                   and thus enables the generation of genetic diversity.  Despite                  its central importance, however, a detailed understanding of                    nuclear fusion or karyogamy has only just begun.  The specific                  aims of this proposal are: to 1) immunolocalize the gene                        products of two zygote-specific cDNAs which are candidates for                  involvement in nuclear fusion in the unicellular alga,                          Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and 2) to screen C. reinhardtii                       libraries for sequences that are homologous to the yeast KAR                    genes already implicated in this process.  The first goal will                  be accomplished by generating antibodies against fusion                         proteins created using an expression vector that positions a                    collagen linker between B-galactosidase and the cDNA of                         interest.  These antibodies will then be used to                                immunolocalize their respective proteins within the developing                  zygote. It is hypothesized that at least one of the                             polypeptides will localize solely to the endoplasmic reticulum                  and the nuclear envelope due to its involvement in the fusion                   of the haploid nuclei.  The second goal will be achieved by                     generating oligonucleotides based on the predicted amino acid                   sequences of the yeast KAR genes and then screening C.                          reinhardtii libraries for the presence of similar sequences.                    It will then be possible to determine during which                              developmental stages these genes are expressed and whether                      their function in C. reinhardtii is homologous to that in                       yeast.",43|0204000,Biological Oceanography|Oceanography,E.

This equipment will   enhance research in a number of areas which include enantioselective   catalysis, b-amino acid synthesis, organometallic synthesis, organic   photochemistry, and oxidative phosphorylation.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.

The Institute acts as a broad forum for a collaborative and  synergistic approach in addressing two fundamental problems posed in Nuclear Astrophysics, The Origin of the Elements and the fate of matter at the extreme conditions of Neutron Star Laboratories.   JINA involves scientists from three universities, the University of Chicago, Michigan State University and the University of Notre Dame, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, the SciDAC Center at the University of California at Santa Cruz and the University of Arizona, and the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California at Santa Barbara.    The JINA collaboration represents a spectrum of nuclear astrophysics experimentalists, modelers, and observers who focus their research programs on two fundamental research components and related problems. The first research component focuses on the laboratory  and computational  aspects of the associated nucleosynthesis processes. The second research component is focused on exploring the rapid nucleosynthesis during the thermonuclear runaways in the outer atmosphere of accreting neutron stars and the fate of their ashes in the deeper layers of the neutron star crust.   JINA will organize an extensive series of workshops and exchanges of visitors as well as students with leading  groups and institutes in all relevant fields in the US and worldwide. This allows JINA to address the open questions in nuclear astrophysics in a cross-disciplinary, coherent approach and to solve the relevant astrophysical and nuclear problems simultaneously. For nuclear astrophysics, such an approach is essential, as various aspects of the field are connected in complex and sometimes unexpected ways.  A key element in JINA is an interdisciplinary educational program.  Exchange of junior researchers between the associated institutions is a key in overcoming traditional field boundaries. An extensive outreach program addresses the public and helps to attract young people to pursue a career in science.    This award is co-funded by the Physics Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.

A majority of the  measurements use high energy electron and photon beams at  the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The few  nucleon component utilizes a focal plane polarimeter,  constructed jointly by William and Mary and Rutgers  Universities, to measure spin transfer in reactions. One  such measurement will provide an improved measurement of the  electric form factor of the proton.

The                   research is designed to follow up and extend earlier findings                   which showed that red-light activated phytochrome could                         stimulate NTPase activity and nuclear protein phosphorylation                   in isolated pea nuclei and that Ca2+ and calmodulin played                      important roles in this response.  It will be determined how                    much Ca2+ is required to support the NTPase stimulation and                     determine whether red light induces a change in the free                        ?Ca2+! in the nuclear preparation.  Phytochrome will be                         immunocytochemically localized in isolated nuclei to help                       evaluate where within the preparation it may be functioning.                    Binding of purified NTPase to DNA will be studied.  Specific                    DNA sequences that are recognized by the enzyme will be                         sought.  There is evidence the NTPase may be phosphorylated                     by a spermine-activated NII kinase.  This kinase will be                        isolated and characterized to test whether it can                               phosphorylate the NTPase and whether its activation is                          promoted also by calcium.%%%                                                                                                                                    Results expected from the proposed experiments should                           contribute significantly to an improved understanding of how                    light and Ca2+ can regulate nuclear metabolism, with possible                   implications also for models of how phytochrome regulates                       gene expression.  The ultimate aim of this project is to                        understand how the plant photoreceptor, phytochrome, controls                   growth and development changes in plants.  Current data favor                   the hypothesis that phytochrome achieves this control in many                   instances by inducing specific alterations of membrane                          properties in target cells.***//",0201000|61,Agriculture|Life Science Biological,Stanley,J,Roux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sroux@uts.cc.utexas.edu                                                         ,1988,115804,

It is a theoretical study for example related to experiments involving collisions between heavy ions performed at laboratories around the world. The main object of my research is  to obtain an understanding of these many-particle systems in a state of non-equilibrium as well as equilibrium and especially the processes leading to equilibration. The interactions and collisions between the constituent particles are of utmost important in this study and are also a subject of my study. 	The study involves modern quantum-mechanical methods using a Green's function formulation of the problem. So-called transport equations were developped based on these techniques in the 60's but it is not until in the last few years that they have been the subject of numerical study.  The availability of high-speed and large memory computers have made it possible to obtain exact solutions of these equations for some particular cases. I have developped efficient computer-programs and have been in the forefront of these applications with publications related not only to nuclear problems but also to semiconductor and plasma physics problems. 	The study of non-equilibrium phenomena is not new in physics. They have in fact been the subject of intense study within the realm of Statistical Mechanics for over one-hundred years especially since the work of Boltzmann who gave us the H-theorem and the famous Boltzmann transport equation. An enormous amount of discussions regarding extensions and also critique of this equation has ensued. It has played an undisputed role in the development of both equilibrium and non-equlibrium statistical mechanics and for quantative microscopic calculations of matter properties like conduction of heat and viscosity. It has been used in analyzing experiments with collisions between heavy ions. Even so it is however a classical equation with limited applicability to quantum systems like nuclei.     The quantum-mechanical methods used in my study supersedes the Boltzman equation which on the other hand can be derived as a classical limit.  Memory and correlation effects are included. Collective, pionic and relativistic effects are also within reach by these new methods. The quark-gluon plasma is another system that lies within reach.

Although Muridae includes one fourth of all mammals and has immense importance to agriculture, disease, and biomedical research, the relationships among these species distributed throughout the world are extremely unclear.  Drs. Adkins and Steppan are sequencing DNA from several genes from a large number of species in this group.  Based on computer analysis of the patterns of mutation among the species, the evolutionary tree of Muridae will be reconstructed. 	The laboratory mouse and rat are the premier research models for human disease and will soon have their entire genomes sequenced.  Additionally, serious diseases, such as plague and hantavirus, are spread by parasites harbored by some members of Muridae.  Rats, mice and their relatives are also major agricultural consumers and under certain conditions can account for over half of the plant material eaten by herbivores.  Significantly, the worldwide distribution of Muridae grants them a unique role in understanding the climatological, geological, and ecological changes that have shaped the world.  Having the evolutionary tree of these species will clarify the large-scale genomic changes that distinguish rodents from other mammals (including humans) and will greatly facilitate our understanding of their roles as biomedical models, disease vectors, engines of ecological change, and will allow us to reconstruct the history of this group in the context of ancient geological and climatological events.

As might be               expected, the thrust of this work is directed to understanding                  enforcement strategies, their variation, and the properties                     associated with different patterns of compliance.  In most of the               work to date, the level of enforcement effort has been treated as               a given, despite theoretical arguments that show the advantages                 of allowing enforcement intensity to vary in response to rates of               compliance and considerable casual observation suggesting that                  enforcement agencies do indeed tailor their actions in light of                 the behavior of the objects of the regulation.  This effort by                  Dr. Harrington and Kopp constitutes a significant step forward                  insofar as these investigators focus their energy on enforcement                as a dynamic and interactive process.                                                The goal of this project is to specify a simultaneous                      enforcement model, in which the probability of compliance, the                  inspection frequency, and the penalties assessed are determined                 endogenously, and apply it to examine the regulation of the                     nation's operating nuclear power plants by the Nuclear Regulatory               Commission (NRC).  The model will not only permit consideration                 of the relationship between enforcement and compliance, but also                the effects of other variables of interest on compliance,                       including technical variables such as plant size, utility-                      specific variables such as financial, health, or nuclear                        experience, and institutional variables.  The data will come from               NRC records on over 30,000 inspections that were conducted from                 1976 to 1986, supplemented by data on individual plants and their               situations including their record of civil penalties.                                Drs. Harrington and Kopp are testing their theory, developed               in previous research, that past compliance affects future                       enforcement more often than not and is an adaptive process.  This               is a departure from most enforcement work which continues to                    assume that enforcement variables are predetermined and invariant               over time.  The research offers the prospect of empirical                       examination of a more complex theoretical approach to enforcement               and compliance which will be an important scientific advance.  In               addition, the policy implications regarding safety issues at                    nuclear power plants will be useful as well since this project                  represents the first attempt to study the enforcement of NRC                    regulations statistically.",87|0306000,Law|Energy Research & Resources,Winston, ,Harrington,Raymond,J,Kopp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,harringt@rff.org                                                                ,1988,292897,

In recent years this central question promoted renewed interest in the organization of the nucleus and rediscovery of several discrete nuclear organelles.  The overall objective of this research project is to evaluate the role of one of these nuclear organelles, the Cajal body (CB), in the regulation of nuclear RNA processing.  The main experimental system used is the nucleus of Xenopus laevis oocytes, because it provides the unique opportunity to approach this question with unequaled spatial resolution.  Two essential questions will be addressed:  What is the functional relevance of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) trafficking through CBs, and how does coilin, the signature protein of CBs, recruit snRNPs to CBs?  Coilin will be used as a molecular tool to prevent the entry of snRNPs into CBs, without affecting the apparent physiology of the latter.  It will allow the investigation in vivo of whether the flow of snRNPs through CBs is required for some aspects of their maturation and/or the processing of pre-messenger RNAs.  Biochemical fractionations will also be performed on oocyte extracts to identify the putative nucleoplasmic proteins and RNAs that interact with coilin.  This information will then be used in various cell systems to define the molecular mechanisms by which coilin, and the newly identified factors, recruit snRNPs to CBs.  Investigation of coilin's biochemistry and cellular dynamics in relation with snRNPs will provide new insights into the nuclear roles of CBs.  Because of its visual appeal and accessibility, this research is highly amenable to an active outreach program.  It will be applied at several educational levels by mentoring a high school biology teacher and class, and introducing many undergraduate and community college students, including women and minorities, to the wonders of biology and new imaging technologies.",,,Michel, ,Bellini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bellini@life.uiuc.edu                                                           ,2004,293194,

All nuclear transport occurs by way of the nuclear pore complex, a massive structure within the nuclear envelope that contains an aqueous, gated channel. Transport is selective, since only specific molecules enter or leave the nucleus. Selectivity is achieved through interactions between a variety of molecular signals in the transported materials and an equivalent variety of soluble transport receptors that bind these signals, thereby defining different transport pathways. Nuclear import and export are also interdependent activities, since factors that move cargo into one compartment must be recycled back to the opposite compartment to begin the process anew. A GTPase called Ran maintains circularity and directionality by regulating interactions between transport factors in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly, besides the particular receptors by which they are defined, transport pathways can be distinguished by whether they merely depend on Ran in a GTP-bound state or also require GTP hydrolysis by Ran.  As a model nuclear transport system, Fried is determining the in vivo mechanism of assembly of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a cytoplasmic complex consisting of a 300 nucleotide RNA and six SRP polypeptides. To date, neither the pathway for nuclear export of SRP RNA, nor the requirement for Ran in SRP RNA export, nor the factors that mediate SRP RNA export are known. This project will answer these questions. Specifically, transport competition assays will be carried out with a number of RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) known to utilize different export pathways, to determine if SRP RNA export occurs by a known or novel pathway. The requirement for RanGTP and Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis in SRP RNA export will be determined by microinjecting into nuclei mutant derivatives of Ran that either deplete the nuclear pool of RanGTP or interfere with Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that SRP proteins are transported into the nucleus to bind SRP RNA and mediate its export. Thus, the association between SRP proteins and RNA in the nucleus will be determined directly by immunological methods. Also, the rate of SRP RNA export will be measured in the presence of excess SRP proteins in vivo; a change in rate will be direct evidence that these proteins mediate SRP RNA export. Lastly, cell microinjection and in vitro transport assays will be used to test SRP proteins for the presence of nuclear import and export signals, as would be required if these proteins mediate SRP RNA export.  SRP is but one of many RNPs whose in vivo mechanism of assembly has not been delineated. Given its rather modest molecular complexity (only seven components), determining how SRP assembles in vivo -- which is largely equivalent to determining how the components of SRP are transported into and out of the nucleus -- is well within reach and will add to our understanding of nuclear transport and RNP biogenesis in general. In addition, SRP is essential for cell viability, so that deciphering how SRP assembles could provide a new entry point for controlling cell growth.

Special arrays of silicon position-  sensitive and fast-timing detectors will be used for a  variety of cross-section measurements: total reaction and  for neutron and proton removal, elastic scattering and  inelastic scattering (including Coulomb excitation), and RNB  transfer reactions and isomeric-beam induced reactions.  Measurements of the 1- and 2- neutron removal cross sections  from the neutron `halo` nuclei Li-11 and He-6 and He-8 and  the proton `halo` nuclei N-12 and Ne-17 are particularly  important.  The detectors will be used in the focal plane of  the S-800 Spectrometer at MSU and with the new double UM-UND  superconducting solenoid system at UND.  As part of the  project, several specialized detectors will be developed in  collaboration with US-based suppliers and DOE and NSF  supported national laboratories.  Several graduate and  undergraduate students will participate in the research  using these detectors.  This grant is made possible by the  support of the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities  equipment initiative.

It focuses on studies of nuclear structure and nuclear reaction mechanisms in order to evaluate theoretical predictions and to provide a better understanding of nuclear phenomena in general.  Elastic scattering of Li 6 ions at 210 and 318 MeV on a range of targets has provided a global macroscopic description of the Li 6 nucleus interaction in terms of its energy and target mass dependence.  More fundamentally, the data were used to evaluate microscopic folding model calculations.  Extension of these studies to Li 7, Li 9 and Li 11 will illustrate the perturbation caused by the extra neutrons and the effect of using unstable beams.  Measurements of light ions emanating from nucleus nucleus collisions using the MSU 4pi Array have elucidated many features of heavy ion reactions.  The addition of Bragg curve detectors and parallel plate avalanche counters facilitate measurement of heavier fragments and thus broadened the studies of nuclear matter and dynamics of heavy ion reactions.  (p,pHe 4) reaction studies in the 100 200 MeV region and measurements of (He 4, 2He 4) at 580 MeV indicate that projectiles with energies above 100 MeV/Nucleon provide reliable information of alpha clustering in nuclei.  These studies will be continued in order to investigate alpha cluster structures of heavier nuclei with the hope of determining alpha decay rates of long lived nuclei.

The nucleons inside                 such a rapidly rotating system are subject to centrifugal and                   Coriolis interactions which introduce significant changes in                    nuclear structure, including changes in nuclear shape and                       moment of inertia.  These interactions also cause                               transitionsbetween superfluid and rigid behaviour and between                   collective and single-particle motion.

These models  will be applied to exotic nuclei at the extreme limits of  stability, which are studied at the National Superconducting  Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and other radioactive beam  laboratories.  They will also be applied to the properties  of nuclei at high excitation energy, where the unsolved  problems of many-body quantum chaos become important.  These  models are needed for the prediction of astrophysically  important nuclear reaction rates, as well as for the  interpretation of electroweak interactions in nuclei.  We  also propose to develop models for nuclear collisions at  energies between the nuclear binding energy and the highest  energies experimentally available.  These collisions are of  extreme interest, because they hold the promise to reveal  the existence of phase transitions of nuclear and quark  matter.  This is relevant to understanding the history of  the early universe as well as the interior of stars.  Our  work is in direct support of experiments at the NSCL and the  Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.  Our work directly relates  to two of the highest three priorities identified by the  nuclear physics long-range plan.  Aspects of our work are  computationally intensive and will make use of state-of-the-  art facilities.

Theoretical research in these areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the United States and abroad. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Work: Successful completion of the proposed projects will lead to i) A better understanding of neutrino masses and mixings; ii) Understanding neutrino propagation through dense media including dense neutrino gases; iii)  A better understanding of various aspects of core-collapse supernovae; iv) A better understanding of the origin of elements, especially those produced in rapid neutron capture;  v) A better understanding of fusion in astrophysical environments; and vi) Exploring the potential of rare-ion accelerators for neutrino physics. Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: Proposed research contributes to the support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed Deep Underground Science Laboratory and Rare Ion Accelerator. In addition  to enhancing research and education infrastructure of the Nation in underground science and nuclear physics, these proposed facilities will have significant outreach efforts. The proposed research involves collaboration between University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of California at San Diego, as well as international collaborations between University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers and those from Brazil, France, Japan, and Turkey. The principal investigator participates in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. He and other team members are also involved in exposing physics to broader audiences.

Draayer and currently involves five graduate students (four in physics and one in computer science) and one postdoctoral research associate, is to give a simple but accurate description of the properties of heavy nuclei, like those in the rare earth (e.g., erbium) and actinide (e.g., uranium) regions which are made up of a large number of protons plus neutrons (greater than 150).  These species are heavy enough to display generic features shared with neighboring elements and yet show unique individual characteristics that we can use to learn about how protons and neutrons interact among themselves and with each other inside the nuclear medium.  We are seeking to answer in an intellectually honest way questions such as, ""Why do rotational and vibrational modes dominate the structure of heavy nuclei?""  The research involves training of graduate students in critical thinking skills and the use of state-of-the-art computing facilities, such as supercomputers (available at centers across the country) and parallel machines (available through special ""8g"" state funding) that will help define the next generation of megacomputers.     7'  7   7l  7   7   7`  7   7   7E  74  7   7   7   71  7M  7   7   7   7   7   7   7H  7""  7""  7   7   7   7   8?  8            U     WV F    F 0   (<& >Z  t  F 1      *< ^  F &  Ht HH ?p=H~  8  F    F    + F          t  F    ^ & ? u      =     F    F    F    v  v  v   /p0    ~  u  v  v V    7    F  P F  P v  v  v V ~      Q 2  ,    F  ~  t  ~  t   ~  t  ~  u   ~   @                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 !         !

Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability. These studies are a continuation of a very successful program to elucidate the unusual effects that the exotic nuclear halo structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on various nuclear reactions. Another part of the project relates to the synthesis of elements in normal stars, as well as in supernova explosions and other extreme astrophysical environments. As appropriate, the work will be carried out at the University of Notre Dame (UND), Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), and possibly at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) . Finally, the production and properties of Fermium and trans-Fermium isotopes will be studied in collaboration with a group at Texas A&M University (TAMU), and other experiments using heavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies will be carried out. This work will involve the use of the UM BigSol 7T solenoid apparatus, which has been relocated to a dedicated beamline at the TAMU K500 superconducting-cyclotron laboratory and is now operational. Proposed technology development projects include an upgrade of the University of Michigan (UM) dual 6T superconducting solenoid ion-optical system (TwinSol ), presently at UND. Related to this, the construc- tion of an expanded particle-neutron coincidence detector array is proposed. This will upgrade the existing low-energy RNB facility to allow for more detailed studies of nuclear reactions with already-available beams, and for the development and use of new, higher-atomic-number (Z) beams. The proposed research will have an impact on graduate, undergraduate, and high school education, as well as on the development of a technologically- literate work force and the commercial applications of superconducting magnet technology. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, together with faculty members and students from several other (primarily undergraduate) schools located in the Midwest, in close proximity to UM and UND. The hands-on training of these students in the use of advanced, state-of-the-art computational methods, nuclear accelerators, radiation detectors, vacuum and cryogenic techniques, and superconducting ion-optical magnetic systems has already had an important impact on the development of a technologically-literate scientific workforce. Several of the graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who worked on this project in the past are currently employed in highly-responsible positions on national-security and medical-physics related projects. Still others hold tenured or tenure-track academic positions, often at primarily-undergraduate institutions with active research participation programs. The current proposal will allow for the continuation of this tradition, and for the initiation of a new pilot program that will involve high-school students from the socioeconomically-challenged New Buffalo, MI school district in physics-related research. This proposed research will also help in the development of instrumentation and techniques, together with future research personnel, that will be needed for the next generation of RNB facilities, and in particular for the planned US-based Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) . Finally, the development of precision high- field, large-bore superconducting magnetic solenoids with special design features (such as light-weight, low-loss aluminum cryostats) has had and will continue to have an impact on technology transfer to US-built commercial magnet systems used in a wide variety of important applications.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Fred,D,Becchetti,James,J,Kolata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fdb@umich.edu                                                                   ,2004,8362,

The goals of this research include determining the origin of the intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, of the proton, measuring the charge distribution inside the neutron, and studying short-range correlations in the nuclear force inside nuclei.  The work to study the origin of the spin of the proton will be performed as part of the STAR detector collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The measurements of the charge distribution inside the neutron and the study of nuclear short-range correlations will be performed at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab).  	The research to be performed builds on the strength and experience of this group using large-volume neutron detectors and measuring asymmetries of particles emitted in nuclear reactions.  The measured asymmetries of emitted particles in high-energy proton-proton collisions with the STAR detector at RHIC will allow one to determine the contributions of gluons to the spin of the proton.  Gluons are the exchange particle responsible for the force between the quarks that make up the proton.  The gluon contribution to the spin of the proton can be determined only from collisions of polarized (spin aligned) protons.  This group has contributed elements to a new end-cap calorimeter for the STAR detector that will allow better measurements of the particle asymmetries.  The measurements of the charge distribution of the neutron and of nuclear short-range correlations at JLab involve the use of large-volume, fast neutron detector arrays developed by this group over a number of years.  All of these measurements will provide an increased understanding of the structure of the nucleon and the nature of the nuclear force.  This work will provide also critically needed training of doctoral-level physicists needed in modern industry, medical fields, and academia.

While adults of these insects include many aesthetically pleasing members sought after by collectors, the larvae or immature forms are much less desirable creatures.  Many serious pests of crops, timber, stored products and even our clothing are Lepidoptera larvae.  This project will provide information on relationships of major groups of Lepidoptera.  Such information can be of value in testing hypotheses about changes in host plant use or associations, in efforts to explain how pests originate.  It will enhance other research areas by allowing hypothesis testing about origins of model and mimic systems, host plant specificity, etc..  ***",0000099|61,Other Applications NEC|Life Science Biological,Jerome,C,Regier,Richard,S,Peigler,Charles        ,W,Mitter,Tim            ,P,Friedlander,,,,,,,,,,regier@umbi.umd.edu                                                             ,1995,9706,

However, t has become clear that  these particles are composed of even more fundamental  particles called quarks.  The description of the properties  of protons and neutrons, and their interactions, using  quarks as fundamental degrees of freedom, represents a  significant part of our research.  In addition, we can also  study the properties of mesons.  The exchange of mesons  between nucleons gives rise to their interaction at  relatively low energies.  If we work at low energy, we can  use effective theories that are meant to describe only the  low-energy properties of the systems considered (The theory  of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics, is very hard  to treat in the low-energy domain and effective theories  have found extensive application.)  The fact that free  quarks are not seen in nature leads one to say that quarks  are `confined`.  Introduction of a model of confinement in  the effective theories we study is an important part of our  program.       In addition, we study the nature of the potentials  found in nuclei.  These potentials have been found to have  an interesting relativistic structure.  (They contain parts  which transform differently when one describes the system  with alternate coordinate frames, making use of Lorentz  transformations.  Our detailed analysis of the force between  nucleons allows us to understand the properties of the  potentials found in nuclei from a fundamental point of view.  The success of the entire project will yield a good  understanding of mesons, nucleons, and nuclei that has its  basis in quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of strong  interactions.

Also,  effective hadronic models will be extended to study exotic pentaquark baryons from photo- and hadron-nucleon reactions in the experiments  carried out at the Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB) and elsewhere  in order to determine their properties and structures. The proposed  research will not only have direct impact on the research programs at RIA, RHIC, and JLAB but also adds greatly to our  understanding of astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosions,  neutron star properties, and of how matter is formed from the  primordial quark-gluon plasma during the evolution of the early  universe. It further offers young students and postdoctoral researchers  a broad research experience that includes methods ranging from quantum  field theory to statistical mechanics and involving both analytical  work and numerical computation.

One of the most successful theoretical approaches in this regard is the No Core Shell Model(NCSM). Instead of invoking the standard shell-model assumption, that most of the nucleons occupy an inert core, one treats all A nucleons as being active. In this way one is able to formulate a systematic procedure to derive e.ective interactions starting from realistic microscopic ones. This procedure makes use of the similar structures that two- and three-body clusters are expected to have in all nuclei. It was shown that these e.ective interactions speed up convergence tremendously and make converged solutions possible. It has now become apparent that present theoretical techniques are able to accurately calculate the properties of light nuclei using the NN interaction as input. Because the results show a considerable underbinding, it is clear that some extra ingredient is necessary, such as threenucleon interactions. Hence, the NCSM will be expanded to include the three-body cluster (or e.ective interaction) based not only on the two-body microscopic forces, but also on realistic three-nucleon (3N) bare interactions. It is important do this, because, for example, the spectra of light nuclei are expected to be sensitive to the spin structure of the 3N interaction. With these higher-body interactions one will also be able to perform NCSM calculations for heavier nuclei in smaller basis spaces and obtain better convergence and, hence, more accurate results. The development of this three-body cluster approach is an major step forward, as it will enable one to study the e.ects of current 3N interaction models and models based on chiral perturbation theory on the spectra. Consequently, it will become an important tool to probe these interactions. By developing a technique for computing the three-body cluster exactly, one can also investigate its structure, depending upon the number of nucleons in the nuclide being studied and upon the size of the model space. One of the goals of all nuclear structure calculations is the understanding of collective structures based on microscopic calculations. The structure of 12C is an interesting example. The .rst excited 0+ state is believed to have a 3a structure. Converged solutions for this problem are a challenge, but are within the reach of NCSM calculations. Once they can be obtained, one can study in detail the di.erence between the ground state and excited state structures. Another important aspect of the current investigations is the extension of the NCSM methods to arbitary operators. The NCSM is based on a unitary transformation of the cluster Hamiltonian. When one is able to extend this transformation to transition or current operators, it becomes possible to extract meaningful values for physical observables from the NCSM wave functions. The prediction of electroweak properties of light nuclei will be an important application of this new technique.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Bruce,R,Barrett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bbarrett@physics.arizona.edu                                                    ,2003,14714,

It is generally believed that the quarks and gluons are fundamental particles and are not comprised of even smaller particles.  The quarks move inside the nucleon and, by the nature of the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, other quark-antiquark pairs are continually being created and destroyed inside the nucleon.  The net result is that the nucleon is a fairly complicated collection of various kinds of quarks and the gluons.   In order to understand exactly which quarks are there and how they are moving, it is necessary to measure detailed characteristics of the nucleons. One of the goals of this project is to extend earlier measurements of the charge distribution inside the neutron.  The neutron is overall electrically neutral, but has a core of positive charge surrounded by an outer region of negative charge.  Precise measurement of this charge distribution provides one of the most sensitive tests of what quarks are present in the neutron and how they are moving. This experiment will be performed at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Virginia.  Another goal of this project is to try to further our understanding of the source of the intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, of the proton.  In a very simple model of the proton, it can be considered to be comprised of just three, so-called, valence quarks, and it is possible to see how these three quarks, with their own intrinsic spins, can combine to give the known spin of the proton; however, a series of experiments performed at electron accelerators in the U.S.A. and Europe have shown that the quark spins actually provide only about 1/3 of the total spin of the proton.  The remaining 2/3 must come from the motions of the quarks and from the gluons that are being exchanged between the quarks.  This group is involved in a series of experiments to be performed with colliding proton beams at the relativistic heavy-ion accelerator (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York to try to measure the contribution of the gluons to the spin of the proton.  Even though the overall spin of the proton is well known, these measurements will, similar to the measurements of the charge distribution of the neutron, enable us to better understand what is happening inside the nucleon.  Finally, it is also a goal of this project to perform an experiment to study the short-range nature of the nuclear force inside nuclei.  This experiment will be performed at the Jefferson Laboratory and is a follow-up to a similar experiment performed at Brookhaven.  That earlier experiment pioneered a technique for taking ""snapshots"" of two nucleons interacting at very small separation distances, and reconstructing their relative motions.  The Jefferson Laboratory experiment will allow us to do this type of reconstruction with much greater precision.

The key to the successes of this  approach is the treatment of all the protons and neutrons in the nucleus  as being active, instead of holding some of them static, that is, as an inert core.  Hence, the name of our approach, the No Core Shell Model.  By treating all particles active, we are able to calculate exactly the medium-modified interaction among particles inside the nucleus and, thereby, the details of the nuclear structure produced by these  interactions.   Besides giving us microscopic results for the theoretical properties of  atomic nuclei, our formalism allows us to analyze different theoretical  models for the interactions among three particles, the so-called three nucleon interaction.  Understanding the nature of the three-nucleon interaction is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical nuclear physics at this time.  This formalism can also be used for investigating three-particle interactions in other physical systems.  In order to  perform our large-scale no-core shell-model calculations, we have  developed several new shell-model computer codes, which can handle up to one-billion single-particle basis states.  Again such computer codes have applications to the solving of important, outstanding problems in other  fields of research, such as in condensed matter physics and in chemistry. Our research problem has also played a significant role in educating and training a new generation of young nuclear-structure theorists.  During  the course of our current research program on the no-core shell model, we have educated five new PhD nuclear theorists and trained and mentored six postdoctoral research associates at the University of Arizona.  Several more graduate students and postdoctoral research associates have been  involved our collaborations with other nuclear-theory groups in the USA,  Europe, Australia, and Tunisia.

This workshop will provide a forum for presentations and discussions of the world-wide theoretical and experimental efforts for the study of excited baryons in nuclear physics. The goal of the excited baryons study is to clarify the different excited configurations of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon. The main focus of the workshop is to discuss the experimental and theoretical issues concerning the use of meson production reactions to investigate the structure of hadrons, in particular the hyperons and the related hyper nuclear physics, and explore the possibility of using the new hadron facility at J-PARC that is being constructed in Japan. J-PARC is the premier meson production facility in the world today, producing intense beams of pions, kaons and their decay products (such as neutrinos). The Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) theory group at Jefferson Lab has been established to work with experimentalists in the field of hadron production, and will bring new ideas for experiments at J-PARC. The U.S. workshop organizers are K. Joo of University of Connecticut, K. Hicks of Ohio University, and T.S.-H. Lee of Argonne National Lab. The Japanese organizers are S. Sawada of High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) and T. Nakano and T. Sato, both of Osaka University.

Most of their research  utilizes fast neutrons from their small accelerator for  nuclear reactions and scattering, often using isotopically  enriched target materials.  The resulting scattered neutrons  or gamma rays reveal excitation modes at low excitation in  the target nucleus.  The group utilizes the Doppler-shift  attenuation method to measure excited state lifetimes and  gamma-gamma coincidence measurements are useful in  identifying the nuclear states involved.

The project has 7 objectives: to investigate the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) radiation-protection standards, including their ethical underpinnings and policy consequences; to assess the degree to which these IAEA norms presuppose more egalitarian or utilitarian ethics; to clarify the double standard for worker, versus public, exposure to ionizing radiation (worker standards are more lenient); to determine whether nuclear workers are likely to have given free informed consent to higher radiation risks they bear; to investigate workplace standards for free informed consent, as compared to those used in medical ethics; to trace the ethical consequences following from the norms governing worker exposures to ionizing radiation; and to determine the degree to which alternative principles would result in public-policy changes affecting the safety of nuclear workers. Ethical evaluation of radiation-protection standards for nuclear workers will involve seven questions: What are the main IAEA radiation-protection standards, and how do they differ from those for public exposure? Do IAEA radiation norms (based on the Justification, Optimization, and Dose-Limitation Principles) follow mainly utilitarian or egalitarian ethical principles? Which, if either, is more desirable for current society? For nuclear workers? For future generations? What are the ethical and evaluative presuppositions, strengths, and weaknesses of the traditional justification -- the compensating wage differential -- for the double standard for worker, versus public, exposures to ionizing radiation? What ethical conditions for free informed consent ought nuclear employers attempt to implement in the workplace? What are the ethical and evaluative presuppositions, strengths, and weaknesses of current nuclear regulations for worker consent? In addressing these questions, the project team will employ four methods that it has used previously, with successful results: (1) bibliographic research, (ii) assessment of ethical assumptions, (iii) two-stage ethical analysis, and (iv) case studies. After each year of research, a multidisciplinary group of nuclear-energy experts will evaluate project articles. The strengths of the physics-philosophy project team include 4 years of prior collaborative work and different opinions as to the pros and cons of using nuclear technology.  Both are widely published scholars. They have had policy-related experience and hold offices in international risk-assessment societies. The potential impacts of the project include increased knowledge in physics, ethics, and economics; greater protection of worker health and safety; fostering excellence in multidisciplinary and international research; transnational cooperation in radiation protection; and improving international education and ethics related to worker safety and nuclear technology.",0103000,Ethical Considerations,Kristin, ,Shrader-Frechette,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kristin.Shrader-Frechette.1@nd.edu                                              ,1999,19524,

These results will be augmented with real-                time observations of living embryos viewed with Nomarski DIC                    optics and documented with video technology.  These results, in                 conjunction with the previous work will provide the descriptive                 foundations for which many known Drosophila mutations affecting                 early development can be analyzed.  3)  To examine in greater                   detail the effects mutations in the engrailed and even-skipped                  genes have on early development.  Mutations in these two genes                  are lethal to the embryo, and disrupt segmentation in a                         reproducible and spatially specific manner.  This proposal is                   designed to further our understanding of the relationship between               these genes and cytoskeletal elements in the embryo that provide                structure and movement, with special emphasis on the actin and                  tubulin-based cytoskeletons.  In the long term, an understanding                of how these and other genes act to build the body plan of                      Drosophila should tell us how similar genes work in higher                      eukaryotes including humans.                                                    %%%                                                                                 Fertilization of an egg by the sperm initiates a                            developmental program that results in a fully viable adult                      animal.  This developmental program is completely specified by                  the contents of the fertilized egg, and the challenge facing                    developmental biologists is to decipher exactly how the                         information that is present in the egg is first stored, and then                subsequently utilized and processed as the embryo develops.

Specific areas that will receive attention include:  pion-induced  single and double charge exchange at LAMPF, muon capture at LAMPF  and TRIUMF, (n.p) single charge exchange at TRIUMF, electron  scattering at CEBAF and as part of the HERMES project at DESY,  and nuclear structure experiments at Michigan State and  elsewhere.  The single charge exchange experiments make use of  the new neutral meson spectrometer (NMS) at LAMPF and have two  major components - search for isovector spin-flip giant dipole  resonances, and non-analog single charge exchange as pathways in  sequential double charge exchange.  The double charge exchange  program seeks 1) to elucidate the role of single and double spin  flip, both to low-lying discrete states and to giant resonances,  2) to populate giant resonances built on the isovector giant  monopole, and 3) to clarify non-sequential aspects of the  reaction mechanism.  The muon capture experiments at LAMPF and  TRIUMF determine the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant of  the semileptonic weak interaction.  The (n.p) program at TRIUMF  include extraction of strength of higher multipoles - the spin  flip dipole and quadrupole.  The HERMES proposal involves the use  of newly developed polarized gas target technology to study in a  complete and precise way to spin structure of the nucleon.  It  will measure spin-dependent deep inelastic scattering from the  proton and neutron using the longitudinally polarized electron  beam of the HERA storage ring in Germany.  At CEBAF , several  issues are addressed.  Those include measurements of the  propagation of nucleons through the nuclear medium, in particular  an effect called color transparency, they also include pion  electroproduction on nucleons in nuclei and the study of the  structure of nuclei containing strange baryons.  Work in the area  of nuclear structure will concentra te on investigation of the  behavior of systems with a neutron-to-proton ratio significantly  different from that found in stable nuclei.  Particle gamma  coincidence techniques will be used to observe electromagnetic  transitions in nuclei with nearly equal numbers of neutrons and  protons with masses between 54 and 84.  Work on elementary  excitations in very light highly neutron-rich systems such as 6He  and 8He will also be pursued.  The relative role of Coulomb and  nuclear forces in the breakup of 6He and related systems will be  studies at energies near 60 MeV/nucleon using a highly efficient  array of scintillation detectors to tag events in which breakup  is accompanied by gamma rays from the target.  ***",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,H.,T,Fortune,Robert,W,Zurmuhle,David          ,P,Balamuth,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1995,19936,

The spin of the proton is an essential property that determines the structure of matter, yet we know that only a small part of the spin comes from the three quarks that form the proton.  The STAR-SPIN group would definitively measure the contribution from the gluons, the short-lived particles that hold the quarks together and which account for much of its mass to see if that is where the missing spin resides.The measurement of the gluon contribution to the proton spin will be carried out by adding  a special detector for high energy  gamma rays to the STAR detector located at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.  The detector is now being built using separate NSF construction funds. 	The force between pairs of neutrons and protons cannot, by itself, account for the strength that binds the nucleus together.  New, three-body forces are needed, but their form is almost unknown.  By manipulating the neutron and proton spins when three of them come together, the PINTEX collaboration would produce a map to guide a theory of such three-body force. .  FY2002 will be the last year of data taking using the intense beams and unique capabilities of the Indiana University Cooler Facility to study these three-body forces.  	The weak force between nucleons, which can change the form of matter, is still                         poorly understood.  By making a measurement accurate to one part in a billion on the                           formation of a deuteron from a neutron and a proton, the IU neutron group would measure                              the longest-range part of the weak force . The Indiana group would support studies of the                               weak force and other effects accessible using cold neutrons at NIST and LANSCE and by providing crucial parts of the experimental apparatus.    	There is mounting evidence that neutrinos, one of the most ubiquitous particles in the universe, may have mass, thus changing our most elegant theories of matter and how it controls the expansion of the universe.  The neutrino group would check a recent observation from LANL of a few cases where neutrinos, because they have mass, spontaneously change from one neutrino type into another by collecting a large enough data sample to settle this issue.  	A key component of the Indiana program will be the training of students to become the next generation of researchers.  This effort includes the involvement of post-doctoral associates in critical experimental roles, guiding the research of graduate students, involving undergraduates through the NSF-funded REU summer program and part-time employment, and reaching out to make the community aware of our scientific mission.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.

Continuous maps   between topological spaces are of fundamental importance in   topology. As their noncommutative counterparts, homomorphisms   are of fundamental importance in the theory of C*-algebras.   One part of the project is to determine when two   homomorphisms from one unital separable nuclear C*-algebra  to another C*-algebra are (stably) approximately unitarily   equivalent. It is always in  the  center of the theory of   C*-algebras to determine when two C*-algebras are isomorphic   and to describe their invariants. Another part of the project   is to classify (simple) nuclear separable C*-algebras   via their K-theory. These two parts are closely related and both   involve the general theory of C*-algebras, KK-theory, the   theory of automorphisms, the C*-algebra extension theory, the   group representations  as well as  algebraic topology.        Many important and significant problems in engineering, the  physical sciences, and social sciences require the knowledge   of linear algebras (or matrix algebras) to solve them.  Many problems in linear algebras, in particular asymptotic and   approximation problems in linear algebras are best described    in infinite dimensional linear algebras. The study of C*-algebras   is the study of infinite dimensional linear algebras. However  the   applications of C*-algebras range from linear algebras, operator   theory, group representations, dynamic systems, to model quantum   field theory and quantum statistical mechanics. For the development   of the theory of C*-algebras as well as for the purpose of   applications to other areas, it is primarily important to have a   better understanding of the structure of C*-algebras. It is the   ambitious goal of this project to determine the structure of   C*-algebras with fewest possible data.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Huaxin, ,Lin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hlin@uoregon.edu                                                                ,1998,26436,

A. Brown and V. Zelevinsky, together with M. Horoi (Central Michigan University). The research proposed encompasses a broad range of topics in nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics important for the ongoing program at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The main components are structural properties of nuclei, including those far from stability, and their manifestation in nuclear reactions and astrophysical phenomena. The rich experience of the group and the support from MSU and NSCL provides the .rm basis for a diverse and topical research program. The proposed research is in the mainstream of modern nuclear physics that is directed to answering principal questions what are the limits of stability of nuclei, how did the chemical evolution of the Universe proceed, what are the ways of self-organization in interacting many-body systems - how does order coexist with chaos and complexity.   Concrete directions of the proposed research logically follow from the previous experience of the group. Suggested main topics are (i) development of new analytical and computational tools for the description of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions, especially for the nuclei far from stability; (ii) detailed consideration of speci.c nuclear phenomena and nuclear processes that shed light on the new features encountered with the advances into virgin territory of unstable nuclei; (iii) calculations and modeling of structural and dynamical aspects of nuclear processes of astrophysical interest; (iv) studies of many-body quantum chaos and its coexistence with collective and regular features in nuclear structure and reactions. The suggested program is expected to have appreciable impact on the development in the .eld of nuclear theory and nuclear astrophysics. It will also in.uence the direction of the experimental e.orts. In a broader context, successful progress in the program is important for our understanding of the basic constituents of matter and nucleosynthesis in the Universe. The studies of many-body properties, chaos and collectivity in nuclear structure, have a strong interdisciplinary aspect since the nucleus is an exemplary case of a self-sustaining .nite Fermisystem with strong interactions. Historically, many ideas .rst formulated in the context of nuclear theory fertilized other branches of physics. The proposed research is expected to help studies in physics of Bose- and Fermi-condensates, complex molecules, solid state microdevices and quantum computing.

The chloroplast, the specific plastid type that performs photosynthesis, contains internal membranes called thylakoids required for this process. Nongreen plant tissues that do not photosynthesize contain other characteristic plastid types, including the etioplast in the embryonic leaves of dark-grown angiosperm seedlings. The hallmark of maturing etioplasts is a paracrystalline inner membrane of unknown function termed the prolamellar body. When dark-grown seedlings that have germinated underground emerge from the soil, light causes etioplasts to differentiate into chloroplasts. Such seedlings begin to green and form photosynthetically active thylakoids due to the strictly light-dependent synthesis of chlorophyll catalyzed by the NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase enzyme concentrated in the prolamellar body. Mature chloroplasts are thought to contain more than 3000 distinct proteins. More than 95 % of these proteins are encoded by genes specified by DNA in the nucleus and the remainder by the genes of the much smaller plastid genome. Because nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are synthesized in the cytosol rather than the plastid, they must be imported into that cellular compartment. Multiple mechanisms have evolved to help coordinate gene expression and protein production between the nucleus and the chloroplast. For example, several distinct chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling pathways that regulate primarily nuclear genes required for photosynthesis have been identified and partially characterized. In contrast, the potential for etioplast-to-nucleus signaling in the dark to regulate nuclear gene expression before greening begins has remained virtually unexplored. The research planned encompasses three main goals: (1) To use a whole genome approach to identify all genes of Arabidopsis, as a model for other plant species, whose expression is strongly regulated by etioplast development in dark-grown seedlings, (2) To confirm the link between etioplast differentiation and the regulation of these target nuclear genes using independent assays, (3) To determine target gene expression patterns, and the subcellular localization and function of the corresponding protein products in dark-grown and greening seedlings. This research will provide a basis for exploring communication within plant cells between the etioplast and the nucleus. A thorough understanding of this process is essential because light-dependent chloroplast maturation is required to establish photosynthetic energy metabolism in germinating seedlings. 		An important aspect of this project will be to provide opportunities for training scientific researchers at the graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral levels. Different aspects of the research will provide exposure to contemporary molecular-genetic and biochemical methods applicable to higher plants. The researchers involved will be encouraged to disseminate their findings through public presentations and outreach activities, and to actively participate in scientific meetings and professional societies.

Lin is supported by a grant from the                          Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for the application of                  pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.  This                      technique will be used to study the mechanisms of spin                          polarization transfer from electron spins to nuclear spins                      (Dynamic Nuclear Polarization processes) which invoke the                       photo-excited triplet states of organic solids.  Three aspects                  will be investigated:  resonance polarization transfer via the                  integrated solid effect, coherent polarization transfer via the                 spin locking experiment, and electron-nuclear cross                             polarization dynamics at the level anticrossing region.  The                    results of these studies are expected to provide the                            information which will allow formulation of a theory of the                     resonance polarization transfer and the cross polarization                      processes in general.                                                           %%%                                                                             The enhancement of the proton nuclear magnetic resonance signal                 in some organic solids can be as high as a factor of 15,000                     compared to the normal signal.

A second goal is to explore the fundamental properties and underlying nuclear structure leading to the existence of long-lived highly-excited isomeric state and to elucidate the feasibility of achieving stimulated depopulation of isomeric states for controllable release of stored energy which could have broad applications.   This program at ATLAS will exploit the Rochester 4p heavy-ion detector CHICO, plus Gammasphere, this nation's premier high-resolution gamma-ray facility. The Rochester/LLNL Bambino heavy-ion detector system will be used with the new Tigress high-resolution tracking gamma-ray facility at ISAC2. The important developments of CHICO and Bambino, contributions to Gammasphere, and the techniques of Coulomb excitation, heavy-ion induced transfer, and fission-fragment spectroscopy, are the culmination of many years of effort at Rochester. Cline will continue to be involved in the development of GRETA, the next generation high-resolution gamma-ray detector technology that employs the new concept of tracking the location and energy of every gamma-ray interaction. Such detectors will provide a resolving power that is orders of magnitude better than currently available, enabling studies that at present are inaccessible to nuclear science. Besides having an enormous impact on nuclear science, the potential impact of such gamma-ray tracking and imaging detectors will be considerable to a wide range of applications, including astrophysics, medicine, industry, and nuclear safeguards. The proposed research program will be an ideal environment for graduate and post-doctoral education.

Some activities and expected results include the study of  high-momentum nucleons in nuclear ground states by applying  Green's function techniques to quantitative prediction of the  (e,e'p) cross section.  A corresponding study will assess the  potential of two-proton removal experiments as a probe of the  nucleon-nucleon interaction in the nuclear medium.  Calculations  involving self-consistent determination of nuclear-matter  spectral functions will establish the density dependence of  medium modifications of nucleons and their effective interactions  and generate in-medium phase shifts and cross sections relevant  to the analysis of heavy-ion collisions.       Fundamental features of pairing by predominantly repulsive  interactions will be studied in the framework of a new separation  transformation of the gap equation.  Correlated basis functions  (CBF) calculations of superfluid pairing gaps in neutron-star  matter will furnish critical inputs for models of the rotational  dynamics and thermal evolution of neutron stars.  Variational-CBF  and correlated density matrix theories adapted to inhomogeneous  environments will be applied to pairing in non-uniform nuclear  systems, resonant vapor modes of the helium liquid-vapor  interface, Bose-Einstein condensation phenomena in trapped atomic  clouds, and phase transitions in lattice spin systems and lattice  gauge models.

The measurements are performed at the KN&JN high current accelerators at the University of Notre Dame. One ocus of the measurements will be the study of reactions in the NeNa cycle which is of importance for hydrogen shell burning during late stellar evolution and also for explosive hydrogen burning in novae. For helium burning, the experiments will concentrate on the measurement of stellar neutron sources during the red giant phase of stellar evolution and in supernovae shockfronts. The experiments are designed for using forward and inverse kinematics in a complementary manner. The measurements will be performed using a re-circulating gas-target system which can be operated with different light and heavy target gas material (H,He,Ne). The reaction products will be measured with a set of Ge-clover detectors for gamma-radiation and a dedicated Si-strip detector array for particles.

The projects  share, in the main, the methods and models of the few-body  problem, attention to the successful phenomenology of the  strong interaction at the hadronic and at the quark level,  and use of the electromagnetic interaction as a probe of  properties of systems bound by the strong interaction.  I  will continue a study of the spin structure of $^6$Li  because it is being used as a target of polarized neutrons  for high-energy experiments which seek to understand the  quark-gluon structure of the nucleon.  Other projects in  medium energy physics include pion production at threshold  in nucleon-nucleon collisions, and pion photo- and  electroproduction from nucleons at threshold.  I will  continue to study meson mixing related to the charge  asymmetry in the nuclear force, and attempt to extract  low  energy Lambda-neutron scattering parameters from radiative  kaon capture on the deuteron.  The projects are intended  develop our understanding of the strong interaction,  especially as it manifests itself in few nucleon systems,  and to support current experimental work being done in  Europe and North America.

These include the exploration of nuclear processes in an environment extremely rich of electrons and neutrons, and the formation of new states of matter in the cores of such objects, like a plasma of quarks and gluons which is being sought at the most powerful terrestrial particle colliders. This NSF supported research project aims at exploring such processes from observed neutron star data. It is divided into two major activities.   The first activity deals with X-ray neutron stars accreting matter from companions. Such neutron stars accrete typically many millions of tons of matter per second, which hit the stellar surface at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This leads to thermonuclear reactions on the stellar surface whose ashes gravitate gradually inward, causing significant changes (e.g. nuclear fusion reactions) in the star's crust. The major goal of this activity is to explore the impact of these thermonuclear reactions on the thermal evolution of accreting neutron stars.   The second activity concerns our understanding of the fundamental physics realized in the ultra-dense core of neutron stars, where neutrons and protons might be broken up into their quark constituents, creating a new state of matter known as quark matter. If quark matter exists in the cores of neutron stars, it will be a color superconductor whose condensation pattern is very complex. It has also been theorized that neutron stars could in fact be quark stars, objects made entirely of quark matter. In the framework of this activity, research on potential astrophysical signatures signaling the existence of quark matter in ""neutron"" stars will be carried out.   These research activities are crucial to obtain the full physics potential of the investments that are made in astrophysical detectors, at Jefferson Lab, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), as well as new investments that are recommended for the Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA).   The researchers and students involved in this project will develop multi-media lectures on how stars work and present them to middle and high school students and teachers in the San Diego area.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Fridolin, ,Weber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fweber@sciences.sdsu.edu                                                        ,2005,33964,

Currently, the only high  field NMR spectrometer at  Princeton University is a seven  year old JEOL GSX-500.  This spectrometer is the critical  limiting factor to the following projects involving  Chemistry faculty members and their groups.    * Warren S. Warren    Recent demonstrations of intermolecular coherence transfer  between proteins and bulk water in solution open us a  variety of novel applications to enhance signals in  biomolecular NMR and imaging.  600 MHz data on a modern  spectrometer with high sensitivity probes and fast gradient  pulses (done in collaboration) have proven the importance of  the technique.  500 MHz data with the existing spectrometer  are essentially useless for these studies.    * Dan Kahne    Multi-dimensional NMR is used extensively in a major project  directed towards understanding DNA-carbohydrate  interactions.  500 Mhz spectra show severe spectra overlap  in these systems, which have been shown to be substantially  reduced in 600 MHz spectra.    * Michael Hecht    Systematic design and synthesis of novel proteins for  compartive studies of structure and properties depend on  multi-nuclest, multi-dimensional high-field NMR for complete  assignment and solution structure determination.  600 Mhz  studies have been started in collaborative work.    * John T. Groves    Extremely high sensitivity proton NMR is required for  structural investigations of small molecules dissolved in  phospholipid membranes, and for studies of kinetics of  transmembrane ligand exchange.  The current 500 Mhz is not  sufficiently sensitive for much of this work, which is part  of a broad program to study the function and dynamics of  cellular membranes.          * Jannette Carey    Studies of protein folding and s tabilty and the relation of  these properties to ligand-binding activity require access  to multi-dimensional NMR capabilties with the dispersion  afforded by a modern 600 MHz spectrometer.    These research areas, spanning biostructural and physical  chemistry, present an extremely diverse set of requirements  that can only be met by a 600 MHz spectrometer.  Moreover,  the addition of a second high field would provide necessary  capacity for less restrictive utilization of the existing  500 MHz spectrometer.",61|0201000|0203000,Life Science Biological|Agriculture|Health,Herschel,A,Rabitz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hrabitz@princeton.edu                                                           ,1995,36413,

The collective modes of these nuclei  involve a large fraction of the total number of constituent  nucleons and therefore a special shell-model theory --- one that  is not bound by the usual constraints of an independent particle  picture --- is required to understand these collective features.  The proposed research will focus on several matters:  potential  energy surfaces and excitation energies; electromagnetic moments  and transition strengths; giant resonances; nuclear currents;  double beta decay strengths; and superdeformation.  However, a  deeper and more challenging objective of the proposed research is  to probe those special features of the nucleon-nucleon  interaction that give rise to mean fields and observed collective  phenomena.  In particular, the proposed program will continue to  focus on the origin of pseudo-spin symmetry and the complementary  of proton and neutron dynamics.  The training of graduate  students (currently five) and the building of international  collaborations (from former Soviet Union countries and Mexico, in  particular) are an integral part of the research  effort.

Of particular interest for this project is the observation that distinct mitochondrial   DNA molecules, each containing only a portion of the genetic information, are retained in the genome at strikingly different relative copy number.  What accounts for this unusual organization in plants is not well understood.  It is clear that many features of the mitochondrial genome, including DNA copy number, are under nuclear gene control.  This project is designed to test the hypothesis that nuclear-directed copy number control of mitochondrial DNA molecules serves as a means of suppressing mitochondrial mutations in plants.  To test this hypothesis, the CHM gene in Arabidopsis thaliana has been cloned.  Mutations in this gene result in the amplification of mitochondrial DNA molecules that contain mutations.  Thus, characterization of this gene, its product, and its mode of action should allow a direct test of the stated hypothesis.  We plan to confirm the identity of the CHM clone, to localize its gene product, and to genetically test its function.",,,Sally,A,Mackenzie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,smackenzie2@unl.edu                                                             ,1998,36604,

Spolsky Thomas M. Uzzell  Drs. Christina M. Spolsky and Thomas M. Uzzell of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, have been awarded a grant to study the interaction of genomic imprinting and unusual reproductive lifestyles in salamanders.  Mole salamanders (genus Ambystoma) include a variety of clonally-reproducing lineages that are almost exclusively female. Such clonal females are hybrids between sexually reproducing species, and might be expected to be sterile. Nevertheless, the clonal females are capable of reproducing and have broad geographic ranges in which they are common. The mitochondrial DNA of the clonal forms, although distinct, most resembles that in a species in one species group of Ambystoma, whereas the nuclear genetic material (DNA contained in chromosomes) resembles that of two species in another species group. This award will be used to obtain genetic material from tissues of selected sexual species and clonal individuals. All the genes that encode proteins will be archived in so-called cDNA libraries. Two of the nuclear genes (serum albumin and serpin) will be isolated from these libraries and sequenced. These sequences will be used to design and test primers that permit identification of the genomic composition of clonal individuals.  The mitochondrial genomes of clonally-reproducing mole salamanders are distinctive, and suggest that these lineages have existed for 3-5 million years. This is far longer than expected according to evolutionary theory, because gradual accumulation of deleterious mutations should eventually doom any strictly clonal lineage to extinction. The paradox posed by the long independent survival of the mitochondrial DNA given the brief survival expected from theory suggests that occasionally nuclear chromosome sets of the clonal salamanders are replaced, in sexual rather than clonal reproduction, by nuclear chromosome sets from males of sexual species. Genome-specific primers will permit an assessment of the frequency with which such chromosomal replacements occur. The data are important for theories about the persistence of sexual reproduction despite the short-term advantages of clonal reproduction. Comparison of variability in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA will provide a basis for evaluating the relative effects of natural selection on these two kinds of DNA in the clonal lineages.

Dynamical symmetries, phase transition and critical points are key role-players not only in nuclear and other physics fields but also in chemistry and biology. We will search for nuclei that display or are close to displaying the characteristics of the E(5) and E(5/4) symmetries, map the trajectory of the Ba isotopic chain over a wide range of neutron numbers in the symmetry triangle. To complement the existing data and provide a perspective for the theoretical description, as well as to assess the degree of symmetry breaking and the perturbations that may be responsible for it, we will perform Interacting Boson Approximation, Shell Model, Cranking Shell Model and Particle-Vibrator Coupling Model calculations. As a result, we will have (1) a better understanding of dynamical symmetries and critical point transitions, (2) new knowledge on heavy nuclei, and (3) a better understanding of chirality in the mass 100, 130, and 160 regions.  The work - a continuation of existing collaborations between theoretical and experimental groups at the University of Richmond and the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University - will enhance and integrate research and education in the theoretical nuclear physics areas while promoting training and professional development of undergraduate students at the University of Richmond, a primarily undergraduate institution. This project is important to the long-term vitality and infrastructure of the physics department. Current students' involvement in research provided (at least in part) the seed for the recruitment in the past few years of more majors and minors in several Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology disciplines. We also expect an increase in the number of undergraduate students fed into national graduate programs.

LOW ENERGY NUCLEAR SCIENCE and NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Wiescher, Michael  TITLE:  Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics   ABSTRACT  This award provides funds for continuing support of research at the University of Notre Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory. The laboratory presently operates three accelerators and maintains an active research program in nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure physics. While interdisciplinary research opportunities have introduced new user groups with different objectives to the laboratory, the nuclear group itself has maintained strong focus on its core program in low energy nuclear physics.   Nuclear astrophysics has emerged as the main research direction, taking advantage of all three accelerators. New equipment has been developed which will provide new opportunities to investigate very low energy cross sections of reactions relevant for stellar burning. Studies range from the direct measurement of nuclear reactions during stellar thermonuclear burning to the experimental and theoretical investigation of nuclear processes far from stability which are relevant for the study of nucleosynthesis in explosive stellar scenarios such as core collapse supernovae to cataclysmic binary stars.  The nuclear structure program has focused on aspects closely correlated to nuclear astrophysics questions such as the determination of nuclear masses and decay times for far off stability isotopes, the nuclear properties of weakly bound systems, the measurement of nuclear incompressibility, and the study of rare nucleosynthesis processes using accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS). An increasingly important initiative is the study of the fate of nuclear matter at high densities, ranging from pycnonuclear burning to the determination of the incompressibility of nuclear matter.   Parallel to these efforts new applied programs such as PIXE and AMS have been developed which are presently being utilized for applications in Art, Archaeology, and Anthropology, in Oceanography, and in the search of new forms of matter (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). The laboratory provides an ideal recruitment and training environment for undergraduate and graduate students.

Using the Laser                  Electron Gamma Source (LEGS) at the National Synchrotron Light                  Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, experiments will be                   performed using polarized gamma rays to study the                               photodisintegration of the deuteron, the E2/M1 ratio of the                     delta, the polarizabilities of the proton and the neutron, and                  pion production.  At the SATURNE National Laboratory in Saclay,                 France, experiments on pion, kaon, and eta production will be                   studied using proton-proton and proton-nucleus reactions.                       Experiments studying spin degrees of freedom in nuclei are also                 planned using inelastic scattering of polarized protons and                     deuterons.  These studies extend a continuing research program                  at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility in Los                        Alamos which has focussed on pion-nucleus elastic and inelastic                 interactions and pion absorption.  The proposed experiments                     involving meson production (absorption) and the fundamental                     properties of the nucleon will provide detailed information on                  the general structure of the hadrons (shape and                                 polarizabilities) and on the hadronic interaction which                         intrinsically involves meson exchange.  In addition,                            experiments involving nuclear targets (other than the proton)                   will yield information on specific aspects of nuclear                           structure.",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Barry,M,Preedom,Chaden, ,Djalali,Gary           ,S,Blanpied,,,,,,,,,,,,,preedom@sc.edu                                                                  ,1989,39473,

Although there are numerous advantages of cpDNA variation  in retrieving phylogeny, several factors can potentially,  contribute to discordance between the actual organismal and cpDNA-  based phylogenies, including taxon density, heterogeneity of  evolutionary rates, lineage sorting, and chloroplast capture.   Systematists therefore concur that comparison of nuclear and cpDNA-  based phylogenies is critical.  This project will therefore address  an important need in plant systematics:  the comparison of existing  cpDNA-based phylogenies with those derived from nuclear gene  sequences.  The approach taken will be hierarchical beginning at  the species level, moving to closely related groups of genera, all  30 genera of Saxifragaceae sensu stricto, and ultimately to  associated rosid families.  Sequences will be obtained from the  entire internal transcribed spacer (ITS) or 18S regions of nuclear  ribosomal DNA (rDNA), depending on the taxonomic level of inquiry.   Preliminary data indicate that these regions are evolving at  appropriate rates for each of these taxonomic levels.       Comparison of cpDNA-and nuclear DNA-based phylogenies is  particularly important in groups, such as Saxifragaceae s.s., that  are noted for hybridization and chloroplast capture and for which  the cpDNA-based phylogenies may consequently be suspect.  The  hierarchical approach proposed may also provide new insights into  the patterns and phylogenetic impact of past hybridization.",64|0000099,Environmental Biology|Other Applications NEC,Douglas,E,Soltis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dsoltis@botany.ufl.edu                                                          ,1993,40165,

Eric Oldfield and Andrzej Wieckowski will develop in-situ high-field nuclear magnetic resonance-electrochemistry (NMRE) techniques to investigate interfacial structure and dynamics in electrocatalysts, with the purpose of clarifying the role of modification of electrode material in the poisoning of Pt electrocatalysts for methanol fuel cells. Both metal surface and adsorbate structures in an electrochemical cell under potentiostatic control will be characterized. Knight shifts, spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times determination, aided with density-functional calculations, will be correlated with shifts of the Fermi-level LDOS of metal and adsorbates. In particular, the research will involve 195Pt NMR of fuel cell catalysts to obtain LDOS (bimetallic particles will be composed of Pt with Ru, Sn, Rh, or Cu); and 13C and 17O NMR of adsorbed CO to obtain diffusion kinetics. Determination will be made of catalyst-support and catalyst-adsorbate interactions; and of the effects of electrode potential and electrolyte environment on surface structure and dynamics. The wider relevance of the research is in the design of CO-poisoning resistant, high current-density electrodes for methanol oxidation, which have potential use in mobile power sources.",0308000,Industrial Technology,Eric, ,Oldfield,Andrzej, ,Wieckowski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eo@chad.scs.uiuc.edu                                                            ,1998,43477,

Nuclear studies emphasize the structure of hadrons, nuclei and nuclear matter; use of high energy electrons to map these structures with subfemtometer resolution; and the developing area of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions where the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter that occurred early in the universe, may be recreated in laboratory.  Special focus is on development of new computational techniques for exact calculations of the structure and reactions of light nuclei. 	Projects in astrophysics include study of the composition and phases of the various types of matter in neutron stars; dynamics of superfluid vortices in neutron stars, with applications to pulsar speedups; effects of phase transitions on neutron star evolution; the electrical conductivity and generation of magnetic fields in the early universe. 	Research on relativistic many-body problems focuses on the theory of electromagnetic and quark-gluon plasmas, and on studies of nuclei with relativistic Hamiltonians.  The condensed matter physics program aims at theories of quantum liquids, dynamical response, quantized vortex systems, Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons and trapped atoms, and atomic clusters. *** ",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Gordon,A,Baym,D.

The goal is to elucidate the structure of matter in terms of its quark and gluon distributions as determined by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The program is based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab).  The RPI JLab program has two major aspects.  First, to conduct high visibility experiments  using the state of the art facilities at JLab.  Second, to prepare a physics program and to design and build experimental equipment  for the JLab 12 GeV energy upgrade. The planned JLab research for the next proposal period focuses primarily on conducting exclusive experiments at the largest possible momentum transfers, in which all particles produced by the electron beam are reconstructed. These include: 1) the deep virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) and electroproduction of pseudoscalar mesons  (DVMP),  and 2) the measurement of nucleon excited form factors. Looking toward the future, the group is  engaged in preparations for the JLab 12 GeV upgrade.  The main long term RPI contribution will continue to be   the design, prototyping, and testing of the Hi threshold Cherenkov project (HTCC). From the physics point of view, the RPI group members are leaders of two 12 GeV proposals.  One, the measurement of  deeply virtual electroproduction of pseudoscalar meson at high momentum transfer has recently been accepted by the  JLab PAC as a fundamental component of the  12 GeV physics program. The other, involves the measurement of baryon resonance form factors at high momentum transfer.  The program will play a major part in the ongoing JLab  program and in the 12 GeV upgrade, which has been specified by the nuclear physics community as one of the highest priority items in nuclear physics. On a broader scale, RPI will continue to produce highly trained PhDs in the physical sciences. Experience shows that these persons typically take on technical  career positions in which are important to the US position in technical leadership. The RPI group, typically involves a significant number of  undergraduate research participants as a vital part of their technical education at RPI. We will continue to do this.

Any meaningful synthesis requires a firm understanding of how the arthropods are related to one another; but the phylogenetic relationships among the major arthropod lineages are difficult to recover.  Many different and controversial reconstructions have been proposed.     In this study, Jeffrey W. Schultz and Jerome C. Regier will determine whether analysis of the DNA sequences of two slowly-evolving nuclear genes, elongation factor 1a and RNA polymerase II, can provide a more robust phylogenetic reconstruction for arthropods.  The researchers will obtain and sequence these genes from a large sample of arthropods representing all major groups, and will analyze these sequences using phylogenetic reconstruction methods.  Studies on other organisms have suggested that these genes are appropriate for the analysis of lineages as anciently diverged as the arthropod lineages are thought to be.  A more fully resolved phylogenetic tree for arthropods will offer a unique and useful framework for addressing basic questions about the tempo and mode of phylogenetic and structural diversification in arthropods and in other forms of life.",0000099|61,Other Applications NEC|Life Science Biological,Jeffrey,W,Shultz,Jerome,C,Regier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jshultz@umd.edu                                                                 ,1996,46890,

The electroweak force (one of the fundamental forces in nature) gives rise to an intrinsic energy difference between right- and left-handed configurations of particles and electromagnetic fields. Here, molecules are used in a novel scheme to amplify this (usually tiny) effect by many orders of magnitude. This should make it possible to measure as-yet unseen features of the electroweak force, in particular how it is modified by the presence of strong forces inside an atomic nucleus.  This work involves extensive student training. Two current PhD students will complete their theses on the project, and another will be sought. Five undergraduates have participated to date, and a similar continued level of undergraduate involvement is anticipated. In addition, this project will continue to provide significant collaborative effort, including: participation of (at least) two faculty members from nearby small colleges, where on-campus research is not feasible; cross-disciplinary collaborations with chemists; and work with theorists in both Russia and the U.S. ",0000099,Other Applications NEC,David, ,DeMille,Sidney,B,Cahn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,david.demille@yale.edu                                                          ,2008,50568,

Specifically, work will be made to investigate how the precession of spin-polarized nuclei of Rb and Xn isotopes ?caged? in a small volume can encode and carry inertial information about rotation of objects. It is estimated that the proposed technology will achieve performance levels comparable to state-of-the art conventional gyroscopes, but at a fraction of their cost.  Several fundamental challenges will be addressed in the project, including the feasibility of operating an atomic gyroscope with a miniature cell, magnetic field uniformity in microfabricated coils, effects of assembly and fabrication imperfections, methods for wafer-level filling of alkali metal vapor and noble gases, development of miniature non-magnetic heaters, and the effect of cell shape and buffer gases on the nuclear relaxation time. This research is expected to advance scientific knowledge in the areas of innovative sensing concepts, signal processing, and system-level implementation. This highly multidisciplinary project will provide unique educational experience for undergraduate and graduate students through team collaborations. High school students will also participate in this project through unique summer internships.

The only exception are such elements as lithium,                   nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and slightly heavier elements, which may              have been formed in trace amounts during the big bang.

In addition, the work will focus on 3-dimensional (3-D)                  hydrodynamic modelling of stellar explosions and how the mixing and             clumping of matter during such explosions affects nuclear                       processes, and how the latter affects the former (e.g., by                      radioactive decay).   Particular attention will be paid to  neutron             capture cross sections for very neutron-rich light nuclei, electron             captures on nuclei beyond atomic mass 60, and inelastic neutrino                scattering.

The nuclear astrophysics work involves study                  of nuclear reactions involving radioactive nuclides.  Some of                   these reactions are of importance to primordial                                 nucleosynthesis, as they determine the possibility of making                    nuclides heavier than carbon in the big bang.  Others impact                    the Hot CNO cycle, in that they describe the ability of that                    stellar burning process to generate energy or synthesize                        nuclides heavier than oxygen.  The nuclear physics component                    involves a search for a new type of reaction mechanism                          involving resonant pion transfer between analog nuclei at                       energies near the coulomb barrier.

The  goals of our research are to study the structure of hadrons  and atomic nuclei to investigate QCD and Electroweak  theories.       The hot early universe is believed to have consisted of  a quark vapor that underwent a phase transition to form  quark condensates and hadrons.  We are studying the  structure of these condensates as revealed in the properties  of hadrons, to be tested at Jefferson Laboratory and other  medium energy accelerators.  Our studies of the weak nuclear  force investigates aspects of quark condensates analagous to  the susceptibility of ferromagnets.  In collaborations with  Chinese theorists we study glueballs, quarkless hadrons, to  be tested at accelerators in the U.S., China and Europe. We  are investigating hadrons at high temperature, with the hope  that some characteristics of the early universe phase  transition can be observed at the RHIC accelerator.  As part  of this research we develop models which can be used in the  analysis of medium energy experiments.

Subsequently, neurons diverge from each other to create myriad neuronal cell types, each with  distinct identities. For example, neurons involved in smell are quite different from those that function in regulation of breathing. Thus neurons come to differ from each other in terms of physiology, neurotransmitter expression, axonal morphology, and synaptic connectivity. The mechanisms by which individual neuron identities are specified are not well understood, but are known to involve the activity of proteins that ""turn on"" and ""off"" other genes.  	 The objective of this research is to increase understanding of the process of specification of neuron identity by studying the fax-1 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. fax-1 encodes a nuclear hormone receptor protein, the type of protein that turns on and off other genes. When the fax-1 gene is mutated, some neurons don't form properly.   The nematode is an excellent model system in which to study the mechanisms of nervous system development by virtue of its well-characterized 302-cell nervous system and its virtually completely-sequenced genome. Other molecules that function in invertebrate nervous system development have been shown to perform similar functions in vertebrates. A human nuclear hormone receptor related to fax-1 has been identified and shown to be expressed specifically in human photoreceptor cells. Therefore, a study of fax-1 in C. elegans may inform on the function of a human nervous system-specific gene. 	 This study will investigate the molecular mechanism of specification of neuron identity by identifying some of the genes that are regulated by fax-1. First, the DNA sequence to which the FAX-1 protein binds will be defined. Second, the genes that are regulated by fax-1 will be identified through two major experimental approaches. In one approach specific DNA fragments to which the FAX-1 protein binds are identified in a yeast-based system. In a second approach, genes that are turned on or off in response to fax-1 are identified using state-of-the-art DNA microarray technology. 	 This research will advance our knowledge about the basic biological question of how different neuronal cell types are specified and may define a new developmental mechanism that is conserved from nematodes to humans. An additional major goal is to advance undergraduate education by giving students primary roles in a molecular genetic research project that involves both ""classical"" recombinant DNA and current genomic technologies.

The research will exploit the premier new radioactive beam facilities, namely the US ATLAS-CARIBU facility at Argonne, and the Canadian TRIUMF/ISAC2 facility in order to probe unusual nuclear structure phenomena in unexplored regions of nuclei far from stability. In addition, studies will be made of exotic isomeric states, such as long lived ""K"" isomers, that have unusually simple shell configurations which provide an ideal testing ground of mean fields and residual interactions as well as for elucidating the role of the K quantum number in nuclear structure.    The research at ATLAS will exploit the Rochester heavy-ion detector CHICO, plus Gammasphere, this nation's premier high-resolution gamma-ray facility. The Rochester/LLNL Bambino heavy-ion detector system will be used with the new TIGRESS high-resolution tracking gamma-ray facility at ISAC2. The important developments of CHICO and Bambino, as well as contributions to Gammasphere, GRETA, and the techniques of Coulomb excitation, heavy-ion induced transfer, and fission-fragment spectroscopy, are the culmination of many years of effort at Rochester. A new generation heavy-ion detector, SuperCHICO will be developed in order to achieve the ultimate resolution with the next generation high-resolution gamma-ray tracking detector systems GRETA and TIGRESS. Such detector systems will provide a resolving power that is orders of magnitude better than currently available, enabling studies that at present are inaccessible to nuclear science. Besides having an enormous impact on nuclear science, the potential impact of such gamma-ray tracking and imaging detectors will be considerable to a wide range of applications, including astrophysics, medicine, industry, and nuclear safeguards. The proposed research and detector development programs are an ideal environment for graduate and post-doctoral education.

Although there does not seem to be a need for trafficking of DNA, which in the case of the cell's DNA is a permanent resident of the nucleus, there now is evidence that the DNA of at least some viruses is targeted to specific domains within the nucleus.  The significance of this is not understood.  It is reasonably assumed, however, that the targeting is important in viral transcription and replication.  These studies will examine in detail the function of nuclear targeting of viral DNA to specific domains, termed ND10, that have been identified in preliminary studies.  The long term goal is to define the molecular basis of this DNA targeting and its general significance for nuclear structure, gene targeting, and viral infection.  ***",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Gerd,G,Maul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,maul@wistar.org                                                                 ,1998,57127,

NRVS, based on the iron-57 Mossbauer transition at 14.4 keV, provides quantitative information on vibrational amplitudes as well as frequencies.  The direction of iron motion can be deduced from measurements on oriented samples. The quantitative experimental information obtained from NRVS provides a detailed benchmark for evaluating the results of quantum chemical vibrational calculations, which in turn provide a means to identify observed vibrational modes, including important structural markers that are not observed with other available experimental methods. Reactive modes also contribute to the NRVS signal, which will allow the group to quantify the energetic contributions of heme doming to biomolecular reactions. Through comparison with computational results, the group will assess whether vibrations remain localized at the active site, or acquire a more global character by vibrational mixing with the surrounding polypeptide. Comparison with conventional Mossbauer measurements will make it possible to explore the timescales for dynamical processes at the active sites of selected proteins.  Work on this project is an outstanding training opportunity. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs will obtain interdisciplinary training in biomolecular physics and cutting-edge synchrotron technologies, contribute to the development of a new spectroscopic tool that will have a significant impact on protein science, and gain exposure to the unique culture of synchrotron science. Development and exploitation of NRVS involves an interdisciplinary team of physicists, bioinorganic chemists, synthetic chemists, and computational scientists at national laboratories, universities, and undergraduate institutions. Development and dissemination of next-generation instrumentation at a multi-user facility is an integral aspect of the proposed work. Instrumental advances developed in support of the proposed work will become available to other synchrotron users.

Current research indicates this unique transport mechanism relies on a protein-based hydrogel, which is both highly selective and capable of operating against concentration gradients. A well-resolved structural model of the NPC has been recently determined. This model and related reports have elucidated many aspects related to the mechanism of transport through the NPC, however critical features of this selective hydrogel phase are not understood. The long term goal of the proposal is to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the operation of this protein-hydrogel. The PI would also like to translate this knowledge to synthetic-based biomaterials capable of performing selective separations and sensing in ex-vivo platforms. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that by expressing selected proteins found in the NPC and rationally mutating the structure of these expressed proteins, a better picture of the molecular mechanisms of transport through the NPC can be developed. Further, it is hypothesized that this enhanced understanding will allow development of model semi-synthetic polypeptide hydrogels that will display biomimetic transport properties. This hypothesis has been formulated based on literature reports and preliminary studies, which show proteins from the NPC can be coerced to form selective hydrogels in ex-vivo environments.  Specifically, the PI will:  (1) determine the relative interactions and properties of proteins located within the nuclear pore complex that are necessary to reproduce selective transport observed in the nuclear pore complex,  (2) determine the influence of the hydrophilic regions of the protein hydrogel on transport and the extent to which these regions can be used to synthetically alter transport properties, and (3) develop a route for generating a semi-synthetic hydrogel using solid phase peptide synthesis.   BROADER IMPACTS:  Biological systems offer remarkable insight and inspiration for rational materials design. To advance current capabilities, fundamental advances in how biological mechanisms, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, operate must be realized. The themes upon which this research is based ? biomaterials and bio/analytical chemistry ? can be used to engage students, especially if the subject matter is approached in an appropriate manner. To this end, the PI has initiated an educational outreach program that is integrated with the subject matter of the research program and involves the participation of graduate students in the group. The outreach program uses visual learning concepts and information dissemination using video conferencing in coordination with podcasting technology, forming specific modules that consist of a podcast, a classroom exercise, a follow-up live video conference, and a short assessment of the exercise. Initially, they are focusing on collaboration with two high schools, one of which serves predominantly underrepresented groups. Both high schools are located hundreds of miles (1300 and 800, respectively) from the PI?s laboratory. This is intended to prove that the educational program under development can use the internet effectively to bridge both geographic and demographic divides. To increase the impact of the program the PI makes initial personal visits to the collaborating schools and participates in interactive question-and answer sessions throughout the semester using video conferencing. Along with this collaboration, additional content will be developed and disseminated in separate podcasts that specifically target chemistry students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Work is also disseminated through peer-reviewed journals. Pedagogical assessment of the program will be performed in collaboration with Indiana University campus facilities.

They                   observed that the basidiocarp (the part  above ground) contains                 cells that have one haploid nucleus, while the mycelium (root) is               thought to be diploid. The meiotic events involved in spore                     formation occur within specialized structures of the basidiocarp                and must be separate from those events that give rise to the                    haploid cells during generation of the basidiocarp itself.  The                 applicants propose a careful microscpoic examination of the                     basidiocarp to determine the site (or  timing) of haplodization.                They hope to identify particular cells undergoing meiotic                       divisions and to characterize the structure of the chromosomes in               these cells.  They also propose a simple genetic test of                        individual cells to  see if the haploid cells have different                    genotypes. If present, such genetic mosaicism could play an                     important role in the regulation of development of the organism.                Besides documenting an unusual and interesting phenomenon, these                studies will provide an opportunity for a  number of                            undergraduates to participate in scientific research.",0201000|61,Agriculture|Life Science Biological,Diane,C,Peabody,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dpeabody@stonehill.edu                                                          ,1987,63354,

K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of the California Institute  of Technology for the period from July 1, 1997 to June 30,  2000.  The research focuses on novel methods for treating  diverse quantum many-body systems and on phenomenological  and fundamental descriptions of nuclear phenomena in  laboratory and astrophysical situations.  This theoretical  work is an integral part of the research in nuclear physics  and nuclear astrophysics in the W. K. Kellogg Radiation  Laboratory and enjoys a mutually beneficial relationship  with the group's experimental activities.  The training of  graduate students and postdoctoral researchers broadly in  phenomenological and computational physics is an important  element of this program.

The key feature is to use an electron/nuclear spin system and to take the best from each.  Nuclear spins make great qubits since they have long coherence times, but they are difficult to prepare and readout.  Electron spins can be prepared in well-defined computational states and individual electron spin readout has been demonstrated. So, the new approach employs the electron spin for state preparation and readout, but the nuclear spins are the qubits.  The development of these electron/nuclear control methods will be enabling of a new class of solid-state quantum information processors and have relevance to quantum dots, spintronics and other electron/nuclear spin approaches to quantum computation, communication, sensors and actuators.  The element that makes this approach viable is the mediation of nuclear/nuclear coherent spin gates via the anisotropic hyperfine interaction.  The direct dipolar nuclear/nuclear spin interactions are typically slow, generally a few kHz, however the electron/nuclear spin interaction, the hyperfine coupling, can be quite large, up to a few 100 MHz, and this provides a means of rapid information exchange between electron and nuclear spin systems.  The anisotropic hyperfine interaction also enables nuclear/nuclear gates.  In the presence of the anisotropic hyperfine interaction the quantization axis of the nuclear spin is not static:  It changes depending on the state of the electron spin.  The control space of the nuclear spin is thus far richer than has been explored for either electron or nuclear spins alone. This research will both develop the theory of such electron/nuclear control methods and experimentally demonstrate them.

The purpose of the conference is to encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research. 	To accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the field.  However, the field invites and needs cooperative efforts on all levels with a range of expertise for its growth.  Therefore, younger scientists from all countries are encouraged to participate in the conference and to present their ideas.  In particular, in anticipation of the future need of manpower and of a growing importance of international cooperative scientific ventures, it appears necessary to expose selected advanced graduate students from the major international research universities to the new opportunities and techniques in nuclear science.  This award will facilitate participation from these junior scientists.

Eligible institution must            also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Funding is provided for faculty research in fields of science and               engineering supported by the Foundation and for the acquisition of              research instrumentation.  Hampton University will use RIMI support to          establish a physics research group to study theoretical intermediate            energy (Nuclear/Particle) on few-body and many-body systems.  The               project will focus on the quark content in the nuclear force, nuclear           physics with antiprotons, and relativistic effects in these systems.            Techniques such as field theory, coupled channels, hybrid models, and           quark exchange diagrams will be employed to explore the long, medium,           and short-range pieces of the Nucleon-Nucleon and Nucleon-Antinucleon           interactions.

In               1919, Ernest Rutherford discovered artificial disintegration and                in 1938, Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassman and Lisa Meitner discovered                 nuclear fission.  Under this grant, Professor Stuewer is                        investigating the routes followed by nuclear physicists in going                from the first of these discoveries to the second.  These                       discoveries fundamentally transformed the field and established                 nuclear physics as the most important branch of physics during and              after the second world war.  Professor Stuewer is tracing the                   origin and evolution of the nuclear models or theories during the               inter-war period and is setting the theoretical, experimental, and              instrumental developments that took place within their                          institutional, social and political contexts.

Joseph Scott and Sharon Broadwater of the College of                  William and Mary are studying the details of cell division in                   groups of red algae (Rhodophyta) using scanning and transmisson                 electron microscopy.  The number, kinds, and orientations of                    subcellular structures combine to create patterns of cell                       division that appear to be characteristic for major groups of red               algae at the ordinal or subclass taxonomic level.  Research is                  continuing on cell division patterns in groups of Corallinales                  and Batrachospermales, which at present are poorly known.                            The investigators are also conducting a search in red algae                for the recently described protein centrin, which is a                          contractile protein thought to be present in all eukaryotic cells               and involved in chromosome movement.  In addition, the enigmatic                unicellular organism Glaucosphaera vacuolata is being studied                   through electron microscopy and molecular and immunocytochemical                methods.  One of the unique characters of Rhodophyta, alone among               the world's algae, is the lack of a flagellar apparatus, yet Drs.               Scott and Broadwater have preliminary data indicating that G.                   vacuolata possesses a non-emergent flagellum located within a                   red-algal cytoplasm.  Molecular and immunocytochemical tests are                being made with the help of collaborators, to confirm the                       presence of centrin and of a reduced flagellum.  The results will               provide new insights into phylogenetic relationships within the                 red algae and with other groups of primitive organisms.",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Joseph,L,Scott,Sharon,T,Broadwater,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1990,83980,

The group will carry out measurements at                 the frontiers of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and                     fundamental symmetries and interactions.  The experiments will                  extend the search for time reversal invariance in nuclear                       systems, for meson exchange currents in beta decay, and for                     axion-like particles in electron-positron interactions.  Other                  experiments will use specially developed equipment to study the                 properties of nuclei far from stability.  A series of                           measurements using the Princeton QDDD magnetic spectrometer will                provide new date concerning astrophysical processes that occurred               in the early moments of the universe.

It will also involve the development of new types of instrumentation, techniques and apparatus to facilitate these studies.  The latter will include the development and utilization of special superconducting-magnet ion-optical systems together with detector systems optimized for nuclear-reaction studies involving short-lived nuclear beams such as Lithium-8, Helium-6 and metastable ions (Fluorine 18-m).  Specific experiments will include studies related to nuclear astrophysics (the synthesis of elements in stars, the solar-neutrino and missing-mass problems, supernova and the Big Bang), and the special structure of very neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei (Lithium-8, Helium-6,...).  The work will involve both graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and elsewhere and faculty members from several institutions.  The work will exploit the unique capabilities of the new double-solenoid RNB apparatus recently installed at the University of Notre Dame accelerator as part of a joint UM-UND project.  Additional research will be done at the nearby National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University.

The phylogenetic interrelationships of these diverse fungal-like members of the kingdom Straminipila, despite the major economic impact of several phytopathogenic members on crop production, is poorly understood. The primary goal is to derive a common database to infer the evolutionary relationship of major genera both within and between established orders. The database is to consist of nucleotide sequences derived from the gapC locus which encodes the essential glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. gapC loci will be amplified by PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR products will be determined either by direct sequencing or by sequencing of cloned products. Taxa to be evaluated include phytopathogenic genera. The inferred phylogenies are to be used in comparison with other molecular and morphologically derived phylogenies both to minimize biases introduced into individual molecular data sets by differential evolutionary rates, and to more accurately reflect the true history of these economically important organisms.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Deborah,S,Hudspeth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,oomycete@niu.edu                                                                ,1998,84502,

One major thrust of the program will be the investigation of radioactive nuclear beams produced at the NSCL by employing three different techniques.  First, differential cross sections for the elastic scattering of the beams from stable nuclei will be measured over side angular ranges.  The optical model and folding model analyses of the data will provide information of the structure and interaction properties of these unstable nuclei.  Second, the outermost nucleon will be knocked out by a proton, and the angular and energy distributions of both the proton and ejectile will be measured.  From the DWIA analyses of the data, momentum distributions, binding energies, angular momenta and core-nucleon correlations will be obtained.  Third, measurement of reaction cross sections will identify halo characteristics and details of nuclear and electromagnetic dissociations.  The overall goal is to derive anomalous characteristics peculiar to radioactive nuclei.  Another major thrust will be the study of heavy ion reactions to obtain more insight into the reaction mechanism and to derive parameters that will contribute towards the determination of the nuclear equation of state.  In particular emissions from non-compact geometry (with low-density interior) and radial flow will be examined.

Chiral perturbation theory offers a systematic and practical framework to translate the symmetries of QCD into those of hadrons, particles that actually constitute nuclei.  Our research makes extensive use of this formalism.  At the same time, for those phenomena which are at present beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation theory, we resort to models that preserve chiral symmetry and that can be applied to complex nuclei. Specifically, we study:  (1) Consequences of nuclear chiral perturbation theory as applied to few-nucleon systems;  (2) Muon capture on light nuclei and its relation to neutrino interactions with light nuclei;  (3) Radiative corrections for the neutrino-deuteron cross sections, corrections that will be of importance for next-generation high precision solar neutrino data to be obtained at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory;  (4) Comparison of the sigma model and chiral perturbation theory; and  (5) Strangeness condensation in dense matter.

We will address unsolved problems in the study of the constituents of nuclei and their interactions, considering the effects of correlations on matter, energy and momentum density distributions of the constituents. We will study the fascinating phenomena of the single particle, few-particle and collective motions and determine the static and dynamic properties of nuclei at low excitation energy. We will employ the many body theory of strongly interacting particles and develop the formalism and the numerical techniques, using Green's functions, Wigner transform and kinetic equations, for calculating properties of nuclei. We will investigate properties of nuclei at and far from stability, in particular, the isotope and isotone dependence of charge and matter density distributions of ground states, single particle energies, excitation and decay of giant resonances, and the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter.  We will educate one Research Associate and three (3) graduate students, whose Ph.D. dissertations will be a major part of the research program. In the outreach activity we plan to educate one undergraduate student. The students will be introduced to the forefront of international research in nuclear physics and to modern scientific computation.

While nuclei have many                      degrees of freedom, only a few are important in describing                      available experimental data, such as low-lying excitation                       spectra.

One such function involves the assembly of spliceosomes, a function poorly understood.   This project will determine the pathway and mechanism by which the U6 snRNA travels through the nucleolus prior to its assembly into spliceosomes.  The results of this project should thus provide new and important insights into this aspect of nucleolar function.   The sequences required for nucleolar localization or nucleolar export of U6 snRNA will be identified by injection into Xenopus oocytes of fluorescein-labeled transcripts of U6 snRNA carrying various mutations with subsequent analysis of nucleolar preparations by microscopy. A mini-construct containing the identified nucleolar localization elements (NoLEs) of U6 snRNA fused to unrelated sequences will reveal if the sequences identified as NoLEs are not only required but also sufficient for nucleolar localization. A fusion construct of U6 nucleolar export sequences and the snoRNA Box C/D terminal stem motif will be studied. Primer extension assays will be employed to elucidate if nucleolar localization of U6 is required for its modification (2'-O-methylations and pseudouridylations). Modification will be examined for endogenous U6, and for synthetic wild type U6 and synthetic mutant U6 (that cannot localize to nucleoli) which have been injected into oocytes depleted of endogenous U6 snRNA. A mini-construct containing a fusion of the region of U6 which becomes methylated by the guide snoRNA mgU6-77 with 40 nt of unrelated sequence will be tested for nucleolar localization after depletion of the guide snoRNA to investigate whether guide snoRNAs play a role in U6 snRNA nucleolar localization. Synthetic copies of fluorescein-labelled U4 or U5 snRNAs will be injected into Xenopus oocytes to examine if they localize transiently in nucleoli. If so, antisense oligonucleotide mediated depletion of U6 snRNA will reveal if U4 and U5 snRNA nucleolar localization require the presence of U6, or, conversely with depletion of U4 or U5 snRNAs, if U6 nucleolar localization requires U4 or U5 snRNAs. The same set of experiments will also be carried out at longer time points after injection to inquire if the nucleolar export of U6 snRNA requires U4 and/or U5 snRNP, and to analyze if export occurs only after the di-snRNP and/or tri-snRNP have formed.  A candidate protein that may mediate the nucleolar localization of U6 snRNA by binding to its NoLEs is the La protein. La binds to the 3' end of U6 snRNA, within the region that is required for nucleolar localization. The 3'-OH of synthetic U6 snRNA will be converted to a 3' phosphate to prevent association with La, thus allowing analysis of whether La binding is required for U6 snRNA nucleolar localization. If so, the specific region within La that targets this protein to the nucleolus will be determined, and whether the state of La phosphorylation is important for transient localization to the nucleolus.

The planned research with the accelerator and at other facilities will build upon the activities currently in progress, and will continue the educational program of current and new PhD and other students. The research program in gamma ray spectroscopy will investigate several areas of nuclear structure including two projects that were started at Stony Brook and are now very active areas of research. The first studies the fingerprints of chirality, which involves the existence of right-handed and left-handed geometries in certain special nuclei, and the second project studies the limit of how much angular momentum a nucleus can carry.  Another research project uses the unique capability of our LINAC to provide intense Fr beams of 107 particles/sec.  The effort will focus on polarizing, cooling and trapping of Fr for precision measurements of the nuclear magnetic moments that are needed to test the atomic calculations of the Fr atom.  The Fr beams will also be used to continue the development of weak interaction measurements in atoms.   The Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory also serves as a focus of many educational activities. Students at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels participate in the research program with various intensities, from beam line construction to running actual experiments.  In addition to these students, high school students, incoming students, and various classes tour the laboratory as an example of an accelerator research facility.

The properties of subatomic particles - such as their mass or the manner in which they are produced - hold key information on the fundamental forces of nature.  Using powerful microscopes comprised of beams of photons or electrons, our experiments are able to probe the behavior of forces inside the atomic nucleus. These endeavors are accomplished using particle detectors located in Hall-B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia.  The University of South Carolina JLab group consists of three professors, two postdoctoral scientists, five graduate students, and four undergraduate students. We are devoted to education and therefore invest a significant portion of our research time involving students and young research scientists in our experiments to provide a component of their education that is not available in the classroom.

Excited states up to about 3.3 MeV  can be studied using neutrons from the University of  Kentucky Van de Graaff accelerator and the measurements  include studies of lifetimes using the Doppler-shift  attenuation method as well as gamma-gamma angular  correlations to determine the spins of excited states.  The  work will involve a collaboration with a U.S. Naval Academy  faculty member and his students as well as personnel from  the University of Kentucky.

TUNL has a strong reputation for providing hands-on experimental research experience to graduate and undergraduate students, who are involved in all aspects of nuclear physics experiments. Research projects are focused on resolving issues in, for example, few-body physics, nuclear-level densities, weak interactions and fundamental symmetries, photonuclear reactions, nuclear astrophysics and radiative-capture reactions.  The REU summer program provides undergraduate students with a realistic and active research experience through the completion of a self-contained 10-week project and through the understanding of the project's integral contribution to the ongoing research program at TUNL. The broad scope of activities at TUNL, which involve data collection, data analysis and instrumentation development, offers the variety in project selection needed to productively involve students who have diverse academic and research backgrounds, capabilities and interests. To broaden the research experience, a special lecture series has been incorporated into the program to increase the students' exposure to current topics in nuclear physics and to share details about the research resources at TUNL. At the end of the summer program, students prepare written and oral presentations that help them to organize an overview of their research projects.

The REU site will provide research opportunities for 6-10 undergraduates in accelerator and nuclear physics. The goal is to expose selected undergraduates to the sense of excitement and accomplishment that accompanies independent research and to provide information and contacts that can improve their chances of remaining in physics.  The students will have ample time to interact with each other, the ODU faculty, graduate students and Jefferson Lab staff scientists, several of whom hold joint appointments at ODU.  Social/Cultural activities will be organized to help forge a strong bond among the students.  In rigorously peer-reviewed projects in Jefferson Lab's state-of-the-art facilities - an environment with a longstanding tradition of mentoring and nurturing students - the REU students will be well guided to make meaningful contributions to advances in superconducting RF structures, novel accelerator design, and particle detectors.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Hari, ,Areti,Gail,E,Dodge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,areti@jlab.org                                                                  ,2008,102643,

Together with Alejandro Szanto de Toledo of the  Nuclear Physics Department of the Universidade de Sao Paulo,  the PI's, Stephen Sanders and Francis Prosser at the  University of Kansas,  will use the Pelletron at Sao Paulo  and the Argonne National Laboratory ATLAS facilities to  perform an extended series of sensitive tests to deduce  compound nucleus lifetimes from the fluctuation measurements  of fission fragments. Fine-step excitation functions of  these fission yields will be obtained to evaluate the  autocorrelation function. It is expected that the  measurements will be effective for lifetimes between 7x10^-  22 sec and 7x10^-21 sec.    The projected series of tests will make excellent use of the  lower-energy facilities in Sao Paulo, where more beam time  is available than would be possible in the US labs.  Higher energy experiments will be carried out at Argonne  in the US.  The proposed work forms a coherent collection  of experiments in an area where little data is available  and capitalizes on the expertise and facilities of the  two countries. A graduate student will also travel to Sao  Paulo to participate in the work.    ***",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Stephen,J,Sanders,Francis,W,Prosser,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sanders@ukans.edu                                                               ,1996,104923,

The particular research focus is the upgrading of the Temelin nuclear plant.  This upgrading is part of the commitment of Western nations to respond to the legacy in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) of unsafe nuclear plants built by the former Soviet Union.  The research will place the Czech experience in the context of nuclear power development in the CEE, focusing on problems common to these states.  The goal is to increase knowledge about the influence of scientific/bureaucratic elites and the role of citizen participation.  The research will identify the significant stakeholders, stages in the decision-making process, relevant legislation and regulations, institutional authority and bureaucratic influence.  During these trips, the investigator will meet with her Czech collaborator.  She will interview representatives of the non-governmental organizations involved in Temelin, and spend time in Brussels interviewing officials of the European Union concerning nuclear standards and reviewing documents.  The second trip may also provide an opportunity to work with the European Environmental Bureau or DGXI of the European Commission.  Research findings will be reported in a chapter of a co-edited volume under production.

Physicists study such  systems in the laboratory and observe processes that lead to  equilibration. The theoretical studies of such processes led  to the discipline of Statistical Mechanics.  Early on  (1870's) Boltzmann gave us the H-theorem and his famous  transport-equation.  Though tremendously important this  equation is unsatisfactory for some applications, especially  for quantum mechanical systems.  Using Green's function  methods Kadanoff and Baym (1962) developed a set of  equations applicable to such systems with the potential of  application to numerous technological systems.  They reduce  in a classical limit to Boltzmann's equation, but are even  more complicated.  Although frequently referred to, they  have in the past been regarded as impractical for numerical  solutions.  Numerous approximations have however been  suggested with applications in plasma-physics,  semiconductors and nuclear heavy-ion collisions.       Not until recently with the availability of high-speed  and large memory computers have exact solutions been  possible in certain cases.  I have  developed computer-  programs for the numerical solutions of these equations and  am applying them to the study of collisions between heavy  ions with emphasis on memory- and correlation- effects.  these effects are not included in the Boltzmann-like  equations previously applied to these problems.  This  proposal includes a further study of these effects as well  as pionic, relativistic and collective phenomena.  The  problem of equilibration of a quark-gluon plasma is also  included in our studies.

The proposed research is to be carried out at the FSU Tandem/LINAC accelerator facility and at other laboratories around the U.S.  Improvements at the FSU facility, including new high-efficiency 'clover' detectors, a radioactive 14C beam and an intenxe, highly polarized 7Li beam will be valuable for investigations of the high-spin structure of s-d shell nuclei far from stability to test microscopic and macroscopic nuclear models, for exploring octupole collectivity in actinide nuclei, and for studying the structure of neutron-rich mid-mass nuclei.  The polarized 7Li beam provides an excellent way to explore how the shape and internal structure of a loosely bound nucleus affect scattering and transfer processes, especially the couplings to the continuum which are so important in halo nuclei.  Our developments in resonant particle decay spectroscopy instrumentation will permit high resolution studies of the alpha decay properties of light nuclei to explore mirror states, cluster structure, and widths of astrophysical interest.  The FSU Tandem/LINAC and associated instrumentation are well suited to precision fast-beam laser spectroscopy of few electron ions to test relativistic and higher order QED effects in atomic structure calculations.  We propose to take advantage of the new capabilities at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory after the upgrade, including the compact beam sweeper magnet which FSU is helping build, to examine proton and neutron multipole matrix elements in exotic nuclei and to probe the momentum distributions of 'halo' nuclei.  Experiments are planned using Gammasphere and Euroball to investigate the quenching of pairing correlations and possible other dramatic phase changes at ultra-high spins.  Our group has the primary responsibility for constructing the two Ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors for the PHENIX experiment, which is optimized to study the interior of hot dense nuclear matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and plans to be involved in 'mining' the data for signatures of quark-gluon plasma. Members of our group plan to exploit the new generation of electron accelerators and detectors for precision studies of the nucleon and light nuclei using the (e,e'p) reaction at Jefferson Lab, MIT-Bates, and the Mainz Microtron. Our group has been directly involved in the construction and commissioning of the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab and is now involved in the e1 experimental program to study the electroproduction and decay of systems containing strange quarks to add to the understanding of fundamental two-particle interactions.

The long term goal of  this research is to determine the origins of nuclear  receptors and thereby shed light on how this important  family of transcription factors enables a cell to respond to  outside stimuli.  The short term goal of the planning  activities is to characterize and clone from yeast a  putative nuclear receptor.  There are two specific aims:  1,  to purify a factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that binds  specifically to a known nuclear receptor response element,  using conventional and affinity chromatography along with an  electrophoretic mobility shift assay to purify sufficient  amounts of the protein for partial amino acid sequencing;  and 2, to clone the corresponding gene from a S. cerevisiae  genomic library, using oligonucleotides derived from the  partial amino acid sequence.  %%%  Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins which control  whether or not specific genes are transcribed (active) or  not.  Many transcription factors act in response to external  ""signals"" (such as hormones) and represent an important part  of the mechanism whereby an organism responds to such  ""signals"" by turning specific genes on or off.  This project  is based on the hypothesis that there exist, in yeast,  transcription factors which are dependent on lipophilic  ligands.  Such factors exist in higher organisms, and  represent those transcription factors which are responsive  to certain lipophilic hormones (e.g., steroids) and other  lipophilic signalling molecules that control development,  differentiation, and hormone-dependent gene expression.  The  idea that similar factors exist in yeast is based in part on  theoretical arguments and in part by preliminary data.  If,  as is hoped, such factors can be identified in yeast, it  will then be possible to use genetic manipulations, which  are powerful and well-developed in yeast, to study them  further.  ***",0000099|61,Other Applications NEC|Life Science Biological,Frances,M,Sladek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,frances.sladek@ucr.edu                                                          ,1994,105273,

Particular emphasis will be placed on two major themes: the use of parity violating electron scattering to measure the structure of the proton as seen by weak interactions, and the use of polarization observables to provide precise measurements of the electromagnetic structure of both the proton and neutron.  The primary component of the first theme is the G0 experiment at the DOE Jefferson Laboratory, which is about half-way through a multiyear program to measure the strange quark contributions to the nucleon structure over a wide range of momentum transfer.  The second main component of the overall research program is to extend the measurement of the neutron's charge distribution to significantly higher momentum structure, and thus shorter distances, than has previously been achievable.  The group's work will continue to development and maintain instrumentation for use on their experiments at Jefferson laboratory, as well as to analyze data and interpret results.

Different peripheral reactions  under scrutiny are doorways to various astrophysical  processes as well as to the structure of  the exotic nuclei of interest.  Novel methods both for central and peripheral  reactions will be advanced, establishing, in particular,  links to mesoscopic phenomena elsewhere.  Sensitivity to specific  reactions will be explored in supernova simulations.

Intellectual merit:  This project will explore a new mechanism of gene regulation in mammalian cells.  Messenger RNAs that contain inverted repeats of sequences within them are susceptible to a process called RNA editing in the nucleus.  Editing results in the conversion of adenosines to inosines in the RNA backbone and is associated with inefficient export of these molecules to the cytoplasm.  In humans most mRNAs of this type appear to contain inverted repeats of short Alu elements, which are extremely abundant in the genome.  mRNAs that are edited at multiple sites can be bound by a nuclear protein complex that inhibits their export to the cytoplasm.  Such nuclear retention appears to provide a quality control mechanism that prevents inappropriate translation of altered RNAs.  The PI's laboratory has found that edited mRNAs accumulate in nuclear sub-compartments called paraspeckles.  Curiously, paraspeckles not only contain nuclear-retained mRNAs, but are also associated with an abundant nuclear-retained noncoding RNA, NEAT1.  Further experiments led to the discovery that NEAT1 RNA plays an essential role in both the assembly and function of paraspeckles.  This represents the first demonstration of a molecular function for a long noncoding RNA in specific gene regulation, paving the way for numerous follow-up studies that will help us to understand the mechanics of the nuclear retention quality control pathway.  Finally, the PI's research has uncovered a role for this pathway in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology, because it is lacking in hESCs but is induced upon differentiation.  Since hESCs are the only cells known so far to lack NEAT1 expression, this finding will be followed up experimentally in order to understand its unique significance in stem cell function.     Broader impacts:  The long-term goal of the project is to understand how dsRNA molecules are recognized and dealt with in mammalian cells, including embryonic stem cells.  This work provides a wonderful and productive opportunity for the training of young scientists and the project will support research by one or more graduate students.  Further, the work on hESCs will help the scientific community better understand the unique properties of these key cells in developmental biology.",,,Gordon,G,Carmichael,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,carmichael@nso2.uchc.edu                                                        ,2009,106198,

The study will be continued to higher                        energies.  A recoil detection technique which is ideally suited                 for use with internal targets has been perfected and will be                    used to measure radiative capture at intermediate energies.                     Several pion production studies have already been made.  The                    technique can be used to full advantage at the Indiana Cooler                   Ring and at GSI and radiative capture experiments are planned                   at both places.  At low energies, a study of radiative proton                   capture on Aluminum showed that direct capture is the dominant                  nonresonant mode below 2 MeV.  An electron induced proton                       knockout experiment at Bates found an anomalously long mean                     free path for 180 MeV protons in nuclei and it is expected that                 these measurements will be extended to higher energies.",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Ralph,E,Segel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1989,108018,

They encode a                   single protein for their replication and can recruit the remainder              of the replication machinery from their host.  These                            characteristics suggest that geminiviruses are excellent models for             studying plant nuclear DNA replication.  The overall goal of our                research is to understand the molecular events that mediate                     geminivirus DNA replication using tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV)             as our prototype.  We will identify the TGMV replication origin by              deletion analysis and by assaying viral DNA fragments for their                 ability to support replication of nonviral DNA in plant                         protoplasts.  The sequence and structural requirements of the TGMV              origin will be characterized by analyzing replications containing               site-specific mutations.  Our initial studies of trans-acting                   factors involved in replication will focus on the single TGMV-                  encoded protein, AL1, required for replication.  Two important                  questions we will ask are does AL1 bind specifically to the TGMV                replication origin and what is its catalytic role in replication.               We plan to purify AL1, study its catalytic properties, and                      determine if it requires host proteins for activity.                                                                                                            The long term goal of our research is to identify and characterize              the plant proteins involved in TGMV replication and to determine                their roles in normal cellular processes.***//",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Linda,K,Hanley-Bowdoin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,linda_hanley-bowdoin@ncsu.edu                                                   ,1991,108129,

The synthesis of yet  unknown types of nuclei an atoms will be pursued and their  characteristics studies.  These are topics of great current  interest within the field.  The experiments will be performed  primarily at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory  (MSU, E.

Much of the activity of the  group is focused around measurements of the neutron  polarization.  These experiments include studies of the  complete set of spin observables in the reaction of  polarized protons with a variety of targets at the neutron  polarization facility at the Indiana University Cyclotron  Facility.  These experiments use specialized detectors  developed by Kent State to measure normal and sideways  polarizations of the neutron simultaneously.  Measurements  with 2H 3He, and 4He targets would study the nucleon-nucleon  interaction part that is mediated by a single pion or rho  meson.  Other experiments would study the isovector response  of the nuclear continuum and the isovector giant dipole  resonance.  The determination of the electric form factor of  the neutron would be obtained from neutron polarization  measurements using polarized electron beams at the MIT-Bates  Laboratory and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator  Facility (TJNAF).  Other experiments include a search for  three-body forces and a search for pion-field effects.  This  grant would also support experiments with the Crystal Ball  at the Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS and the CLAS  detector at Hall B at TJNAF in order to study neutral baryon  resonances and nucleon resonances, respectively.

IUCF is a national user  facility, with research being carried out by faculty, staff,  postdocs, and students from Indiana University, as well as  from other universities in the US and abroad, from US  national laboratories, from other federal agencies, and from  industry.  Proposals are made to IUCF for use of accelerator  beam time and for other specialized resources needed to  carry out the research.  All such proposals are reviewed by  a national program advisory committee, which in turn makes  recommendations to award beam time or to decline a proposal.  The IUCF operations staff provides about 4000 hours of  accelerator beam time per year during a 6 to 7 month running  cycle.       The research program will center around the use of  proton and other light ion beams with energies up to 500  million electron volts, and has several broad themes:  the  study of the meson-nucleon basis for the nucleon-nucleon  force; the study of few-nucleon systems, in particular  searching for manifestations of many-body forces; the study  of modifications of the nucleon-nucleon force in the nuclear  medium as a potential manifestation of the underlying quark-  gluon basis of the strong interaction; and tests of  fundamental symmetries.  The data produced will challenge  current theories of the nucleon-nucleon force, its  modification in nuclei, and the fundamental symmetries which  it obeys.  In addition, IUCF serves a strong user community  studying accelerator physics, specifically non-linear  particle beam dynamics and de-polarization phenomena in  cyclic accelerators.  These data will extend our knowledge  of particle accelerators and the limits of sustainable beam  intensities and beam polarizations.  Lastly, IUCF provides  beam to applied researchers in materials and biological  radiation effects.  Education of students and postdocs is a  strong component of the IUCF mission.

During this time an                          electron-cooled storage ring (the Cooler) will be completed.  The               Cooler will serve as a post accelerator for the existing                        cyclotron beam, increasing the energy by a factor of 2.5, and                   providing beams with unusually high energy resolution and readily               variable energy.

Activities are focused on the physics of nucleon                  and few-body nuclear structure and on the magnetic moment of the                muon.  Specifically, they involve measurements in five areas.                   First, there is the electron scattering program at the Bates/MIT                accelerator that will try to determine if the proton is spherical               or ellipsoidal.  Second, there is a program of parity-                          nonconserving electron scattering at the Bates/MIT and the CEBAF                accelerators that will try to measure new aspects of the                        structure of the proton and neutron.  Third, there is the                       experiment to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon                 at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Fourth, there are experiments               involving proton-antiproton collisions at the Low Energy                        Antiproton Ring at CERN.  These experiments search for new,                     exotic forms of nuclear matter, such as glueballs.  And fifth,                  there are experiments using beams of photons at the Saskatchewan                Accelerator Laboratory.  These seek to study certain aspects of                 the structure of protons and neutrons as well as their                          interactions in light nuclei.

The interest in such studies lies in the fact that, as the  angular velocity of a nucleus is increased, its internal  structure changes due to the influence of the coriolis and  centrifugal interaction.  The proposed experimental program will  be carried out with the Pitt array at Notre Dame, the Pitt-FSU  array at FSU and at Gammasphere.  In the A=70 to 80 region a  search for theoretically predicted superdeformed bands is  proposed.  It is furthermore proposed to study odd A nuclei in  the A=70 to 90 region and in particular the odd-odd nucleus Br-  78.  A series of lifetime studies on Ac-219 by means of DSAM and  the plunger method are proposed.  A series of experiments are  proposed. which are based on conversion electron spectroscopy  which can provide crucial information on the multipolarity of  transitions.  Specifically it is proposed to study the origin of  ""surplus"" electrons that were observed by the Pitt group in Ce-  130.  Experiments are planned in neighboring nuclei in the A=130  nuclei and for different target and projectile combinations.  It  is furthermore proposed to confirm the M1-character of the  recently found so-called M1-bands in the light Hg and Pb region.",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Juerg,X,Saladin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,saladin@pittvms                                                                 ,1994,111662,

Most of the nuclear astrophysics studies involve reactions on                   radioactive nuclides, and thus require use of radioactive beam                  facilities.  Most of these reactions are of interest to                         primordial nucleosynthesis, as they will allow prediction of                    abundances of nuclides heavier than carbon in the big bang, thus                providing new tests of models of primordial nucleosynthesis.                    Another study is directed at the p-process of nucleosynthesis,                  thought to occur in extreme stellar conditions.   The information               resulting from these studies also will contribute to the general                body of knowledge of nuclear states in nuclei far from stability.               A fundamental particle study will search for stable or long lived               ""strangelets,"" nuclei composed of up, down and strange quarks, of               importance to theories of nuclear matter.  The theoretical work                 focuses on new abundance predictions for primordial                             nucleosynthesis using the reaction rates determined in the                      experimental studies.  Work of gamma-ray bursts will attempt to                 elucidate the nature of those phenomena.  Finally, preliminary                  work on a new kind of supernova detector will continue; it will                 be capable of testing models of stellar collapse, and can also                  measure the masses of heavy neutrinos to unprecedented accuracy.",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Richard,N,Boyd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,boyd@mps.ohio-state.edu                                                         ,1993,115057,

The first  is a continuation of the study of the microscopic  effective interaction in nuclei, taking advantage of  new theoretical insights on the effective interaction,  along with better  computing capability, with  applications to a variety of spectral and reaction  problems.

Thallium iodide has an                     extremely high photoelectric absorption efficiency for gamma                    radiation and a large semiconductor bandgap.  These properties                  render the material an exciting candidate for specialized                       applications where small size, high efficiency and relaxed                      environmental criteria rule out use of the available materials.                 The research will develop techniques for producing ultra high                   purity thallium iodide, building on promising steps in this                     director that were taken in the Phase I project.                                     Radiation detectors fabricated from thallium iodide would                  have important advantages over existing detectors, for                          applications in nuclear and particle physics research and in                    measurements important in industrial processing control, and in                 nuclear medicine.//",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Michael,R,Squillante,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MSquillante@RMDInc.com                                                          ,1989,118302,

These hadrons which include protons, neutrons,  and mesons, as well as their excitations, are what atomic  nuclei are composed of, and constitute about 99% of all  ordinary matter on Earth.  The hadrons themselves are  composed of quarks and strong energy called gluons.  Surprisingly, we do not yet know how quarks and gluonic  energy are arranged to produce the properties of prosaic  matter.  Our research group will study quark and gluonic  properties of hadrons and their excitations using primarily  the new high precision superconducting electron accelerator  CEBAF at Jefferson Laboratory.  in preparation for these  experiments, we had been working for many years on the  design and construction of large particle detectors using  the leading edge technology.  Several graduate students will  obtain Ph.D. degrees based on these experiments, and many  undergraduates will obtain hands on experience with modern  technology.

Work will focus on a myosin-like ATPase recently                 localized to Drosophila nuclear pore complexes and thought to                   participate in nucleocytoplasmic transport.  The specific goal of               this proposal is to biochemically identify the nuclear myosin-like              protein.  Work will concentrate on the purification of this protein             from Drosophila Kc tissue culture cells and/or early embryos using              affinity chromatography strategies.  Once the nuclear myosin-like               ATPase protein has been affinity purified, amino acid sequence                  information will be used to generate monospecific antibodies and                oligonucleotides to clone and sequence the gene encoding the                    Drosophila nuclear myosin-like ATPase and to confirm its nuclear                pore complex localization.                                                                                                                                      Nuclear pores are the sites at which movement of proteins, nucleic              acids, and nucleoprotein complexes take place between the cytoplasm             and the nucleus.  This is an important area of current research in              cellular biology, since communication between the nucleus and the               cytoplasm is critical to the eukaryotic cell.  Very little is known             about the transport process or the macromolecules which are                     involved.  It is generally accepted that there is an ATPase                     associated with nuclear pores.  Affinity photolabeling of a                     candidate nuclear pore ATPase led to the identification of the                  putative myosin-like pore protein, which will be studied further                with the support of this award.",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Miguel, ,Berrios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,miguel@pharm.sunysb.edu                                                         ,1991,125170,

A primary objective of the NCGRC is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with a unique forum where the most recent developments and results in the field can be presented, extensively discussed and criticized. This years agenda follows the long tradition of (i) promoting critical discussions of the primary scientific issues in the field, (ii) encouraging new and explaratory ideas for future research, (iii) ensuring that discussions facilitate vigorous and open interactions between seasoned scientists, junior scientists and students. These goals will be achieved via the participation of a significant number of the leaders in this field, (including internationally recognized senior scientists) and the young and rising stars reflected in the population of graduate students and recent graduates.  The participation of younger scientists in the NCGRC is crucial to the continued vitality and manpower needs of nuclear science. Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and graduate students have been selected for participation and are being encouraged [on several fronts] to attend and present their ideas. Their participation will undoubtedly provide them with unique and extensive access to the leaders in their field, expose them to new research opportunities and techniques and help prepare them for the leadership roles they will undoubtedly assume in the future. The program of the NCGRC includes the full participation of a diverse group of young scientists including underrepresented groups.

One of these is a process of asymmetric (non-reciprocal) recombination that appears to directly influence plant reproduction.  Until now, our understanding of these processes has been hindered, in part, by the unavailability of effective model systems for investigating nuclear gene influence on the process.  The effects of three nuclear genes, MSH1, OSB1 and RECA3, have recently been analyzed on mitochondrial genome stability. RECA3 and MSH1 function in distinct but overlapping pathways, while OSB1 cooperates with MSH1, to regulate the appearance of specific recombination products in Arabidopsis mitochondria.  The principal investigators have recently shown that MSH1 functions similarly in tobacco, tomato, soybean and millet, but MSH1 RNAi knockdowns in these species also condition cytoplasmic male sterility. The principal investigators are now in a position to analyze the mitochondrial genome changes that occur when mutations in these nuclear genes permit normally rare recombination activity to occur at high frequency, and to compare the consequences of this recombination in multiple plant species. The central hypothesis is that MSH1, OSB1, and RECA3, together with specific breakage sites in the genome, represent components of an interacting network that operates in plant mitochondrial recombination-dependent replication initiation. The principal investigators propose that double-strand DNA breaks occur at specific locations within the mitochondrial genome to initiate recombination and replication, and that MSH1, OSB1 and RECA3 are involved in preventing recombination between repeats that are shorter than a few hundred bases. The principal investigators test these hypotheses by identifying double-strand breaks in repeated sequences, and in the Atp9, Atp6, CoxII and Rpl16 genes, in which there is evidence of recombination activity. This analysis is complemented by studies of inducible changes in tobacco, tomato, soybean and millet mitochondrial genomes that occur with MSH1 suppression and male sterility induction.   This project will develop a unifying model for recombination-dependent replication of plant mitochondrial genomes, and provide insights into the mechanisms for the induction and suppression of cytoplasmic male sterility, a phenomenon of agricultural importance that leads, in nature, to the gynodioecious reproductive strategies of approximately 5% of world plant species. The minority student training opportunities associated with this proposal will involve alignment with the Young Nebraska Scientist (YNS) Program, in which an undergraduate YNS student will participate in this research each summer.

The goals of the                   program are to seek a description of the interaction of medium-                 energy pions and protons with the nuclear medium in terms of the                elementary pion-nucleon and NN interactions and to learn about                  the modifications of these fundamental interactions by the                      nuclear medium.  Experiments will be conducted at LAMPF, TRIUMF,                IUCF, Saclay (France), and other major international                            laboratories.  The scientific program will include (1)                          continuation of studies of pion single and double-charge-exchange               reactions; (2) new studies of the deuteron and in complex pion                  absorption processes in nuclei; (3) studies of pion elastic-and                 inelastic-scattering reactions with new experimental apparatus;                 (4) development of programs with polarized nuclear targets and                  medium-energy probes; and (5) development of an experimental                    program in heavy meson production with hadronic and                             electromagnetic probes.

The                    laboratory includes a superconducting linear accelerator and an                 FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator injector.  The research of                  the laboratory lies in six main areas.  The macroscopic                         properties of nuclear reactions with heavy ions are studied                     through inclusive and coincidence measurements of fusion,                       fission, breakup, and incomplete fusion reactions.  High                        resolution resonant particle decay spectroscopy is applied to                   studies of selected high spin, high excitation energy states.                   The interaction of collective and single.particle excitations is                examined in f.p.g shell nuclei using gamma.gamma and                            multiparticle.gamma coincidence techniques.  Spin dependent                     effects in reactions, including asearch for a spin orbit force,                 will be carried out using reactions induced by beams of polarized               lithium.6 and lithium.7.  The effects of angular momentum on                    octupole excitations will be pursued experimentally using a                     variety of techniques.

Psychoacoustic experiments have provided                   evidence that some of this suppression occurs within a group of                 nerve cells--the cochlear nuclear complex--which is the first                   integrative stage in the auditory system.  Anatomical and                       physiological experiments on brain slices that include the cochlear             nuclei have identified neurons in the upper portion of the cochlear             nuclear complex that are candidates for mediating the echo                      suppression effect.                                                                                                                                             The major purpose of these experiments is to examine,                           physiologically, the suppression of echoes in the cochlear nuclear              complex and to determine whether the suppression is due to the                  candidate neurons.  Microelectrode recordings are made from single              neurons to various sound stimuli to study the effects of echo                   suppression, since even though echos are suppressed for                         localization of a sound, they do make a contribution to perception              of the sound. Responses of neurons to pairs of stimuli will be                  recorded to determine whether and under what conditions the                     response to a second click is suppressed by the first. Also,                    responses will be recorded from different neurons in the lower                  cochlear nucleus to determine whether there are neurons that do not             show echo suppression.",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Robert,E,Wickesberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wickesbe@uiuc.edu                                                               ,1992,132087,

The projects are focussed on fundamental understanding of the structure and  interactions of nucleons and the use of nuclear physics to perform precision tests the standard electroweak theory. A substantial part of the experimental program involves studies of parity violation in electron scattering from nucleons, nuclei, and electrons. A program to exploit a new intense source of ultra-cold neutrons in Los Alamos will study the beta asymmetry in neutron decay with unprecedented precision as well as other fundamental properties of neutrons.

If this development project is successful, the source will be used in a future experiment designed to test one of the fundamental aspects of the unified theory of the weak and electromagnetic interactions.  To perform this experiment the source must have an activity of at least 100,000 decays per second, and for technical reasons must be deposited on a very thin foil in an area of no more than a few square millimeters.  The weak interaction experiment which we hope to carry out later will test what is referred to as the Conserved Vector Current Hypothesis, and will involve measuring the energy spectrum of the positrons emitted in the decay of oxygen 14.

To reach this goal, the PIs will combine their technical expertise in the areas of high-speed fluorescence-activated flow sorting of nuclei and high throughput analytical proteomics. The experiments will use flow sorting to rapidly purify nuclei from homogenates prepared from plant tissues and organs. These nuclei will be analyzed using high throughput proteomic techniques, particularly mass spectrometry, to identify as many as possible of the individual proteins contained within the nuclei. The project will develop these procedures using two plant species, the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana, and the monocot crop Oryza sativa. These species were chosen since their complete nuclear genome sequences are available. Further experiments will examine nuclear protein composition within specific organs (roots, shoots, leaves, flowers), and within specific cells of the root (epidermis, endodermis, vascular system, meristem, and cortex). The SGER funding will be employed to determine the technical feasibility of this experimental strategy.",,,David,W,Galbraith,Paul,A,Haynes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,galbraith@arizona.edu                                                           ,2004,143400,

The present facility, constructed in  1964, houses a three-stage Van de Graaff  accelerator that has not been in operation since  1989.  With the termination of the Van de Graaff  program, approximately 50% of the facility has been  used by 50% of the research faculty.  Though  underutilized and in need of renovation, the  Nuclear Physics Laboratory has basic utilities and  special features that make it ideal for a  modernized laboratory.       Research programs, currently located in Allen  Hall, a substandard and overcrowded building, will  be moved to the NPL once renovations are completed.   In addition to refurbishing laboratory space,  renovations will include the removal of the Van de  Graaff accelerators and two large magnets, chemical  and radioactive decontamination, and the  installation of additional chemical handling  facilities.  Clean room facilities, necessary for  the development of silicon detectors and for wire  chamber development, will be installed.  The  renovations will provide functional laboratory  space that will enhance interaction among faculty,  quality research training for students, and the  ability to conduct experimental projects that are  too large or demanding of existing facilities.",13|0601000,Physics|Facilities - Repair/Renovation,Ana,M,Guzman,Paul,F,Shepard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1993,149225,

A number of different projects will be carried out with the participation of younger scientists who recently received their doctorates and those who are currently working on their doctoral dissertations in the research activity of the senior scientists.  	The projects will include efforts i) To understand energy-producing activity in the core of the Sun and other stars; ii) To explore the origin and formation of heavy elements in different sites around the universe; iii) To study the properties of tiny particles called neutrinos that are produced both in the laboratory and astrophysical settings; iv) To develop mathematical techniques to model nuclei and similar complex systems; v) To understand how heavy nuclei break up when they collide in laboratory experiments; vi) To explore properties of unstable nuclei that are produced in the laboratories. These projects are chosen not only to contribute to our knowledge of fundamental physics but also to the training of the young people involved.  	 ,,,Akif Baha, ,Balantekin,William,A,Friedman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,baha@physics.wisc.edu                                                           ,2000,150044,

FELLOWSHIPS|GENERAL FOUNDATIONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY|MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO,"9400424  Wadzinski    Normal signal transduction from the cell surface traversing the  cytoplasm and to the nucleus in response to an external stimulus  requires pathways which are acutely regulated by the  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific proteins.   Activation of most cell-surface receptors initially results in the  generation of second messenger or stimulation of a protein tyrosine  kinase.  This signal, however, is rapidly converted via a protein  kinase network into activated protein serine/threonine kinases.   Many of these kinases have been studied extensively, but much less  attention has been given to the reverse reaction catalyzed by  specific serine/threonine (ser/thr) protein phosphatases (PP).   Furthermore, the majority of studies of these signal transduction  pathways studies have focused on cytoplasmic events even though the  concentration of phospho-proteins in the nucleus is thought to be  much higher than in the cytosol.  The importance of protein  phosphatases, especially nuclear protein phosphatases, in the  control of cell phenotype, growth and differentiation is just now  being appreciated.  The long term goals of this research are to  define the subcellular distribution of phosphatases, characterize  specific nuclear phosphatases, identify specific nuclear  phosphatase substrates, define the regulation of protein  phosphatases, and to define regulatory and effector sites of  protein phosphatase catalytic subunits using a mutagenesis  approach.  %%%  This is a starter grant to help set up the laboratory and launch  the independent career of a promising new investigator who, for the  past two years, has been supported by an NSF Post-Doctoral  Fellowship.  The overall goal of his research is to study the  function and regulation of certain enzymes, called protein  phosphatases, in signal transduction pathways of cells.  The long  term results of this research will contribute to our fundamental  understanding of the regulation of cellular function.  ***",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Brian,E,Wadzinski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1993,152707,

It also includes work on dynamical models of the                     quark mass matrix within a given generation, as a first step                    investigating various aspects of the strong-coupling standard                   model, such as the effect of radiative corrections.  An                         extensive theoretical analysis of various hypernuclear                          transitions, now underway, will be compared with data on the A-                 dependence of these processes.                                                       A program on studies of the strong interactions will                       continue.  An improved derivation of the effective Lagrangian                   starting from the basic QCD theory of quarks and gluons is                      being attempted.  Other studies involving the so-called                         anomalous sector of the theory, and an effort to present a                      unified phenomenology of all low energy processes are planned.                  An attempt to compute bag mode amplitudes to higher order                       in the QCD coupling constant via a mode-truncation approach has                 begun.                                                                               Theoretical work in other areas will continue.  A                          calculation to determine the effects on the gravitational field                 due to the presence of matter at nonzero temperature is nearing                 completion, and future work will apply this procedure to the                    early universe.  A model of quark matter in a diquark phase is                  under investigation.  Research continues on the solar neutrino                  problem.

Additional  experiments will be carried out with high energy photons and high  energy protons to study the onset and manifestation of quark  degree of freedom, and the up- down-antiquark distribution in the  nucleon.  Low energy studies will be carried out with beams of  light ion to study reactions of importance in understanding  stellar burning of helium, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and the so-  called solar neutrino deficit problem.  Theoretical studies will  be carried out in support of these experiments and in other  forefront areas including: Monte-Carlo shell model calculations,  fusion reactions, pion interferometry, and coherent- and squeezed-  state pion emission.

The                      interaction mechanisms and formation (in heavy ion reactions)                   of complex fragments will be explored.  Data will provide the                   basis for phenomenological models of complex light ion                          scattering and fragmentation in heavy ion central collisions.                   Also, research will be conducted on alpha-particle clustering                   and knockout reactions.

The atomic nucleus is made of nucleons, which are either positively charged (protons) or electrically neutral (neutrons). These subatomic particles, however, are not elementary but themselves composite objects made of quarks held together by the strong force via the exchange of glue particles (gluons).  The properties of protons and neutrons are a manifestation of that strongest force on Earth. The present theory of that force is Quantum Chromodynamics.   Our research program at the University of South Carolina is based the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. There, we use high-energy electron and photon beams along with sophisticated particle detectors as powerful microscopes of the subatomic world. We try to answer questions like: What is the structure of the nucleon? What are and how can we excite its internal degrees of freedom? Once excited, in which way does the nucleon decay back to its ground state? Does the structure of the nucleon change if it is embedded in dense nuclear matter? Do other subatomic particles change their properties if they are produced in dense nuclear matter? The experimental study of these properties gives insight into the nature of the strong force and allows for rigorous tests of the underlying theory.

Steven Whisnant, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of South Carolina, and Simon Connell, Schonland Research Center for Nuclear Sciences (SRC) at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS), Johannesburg, South Africa.  During the course of the three-year award, the researchers will collaborate on theoretical and experimental nuclear physics research on nucleon and meson interactions using photon beams.  With separate funding, a recent graduate of WITS will work as a postdoc on the project.  Professor Whisnant's experimental photonuclear physics program is conducted at the Laser Electron Gamma Source (LEGS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and with the Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jlab).  As part of the NA59 collaboration at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), the researchers at WITS are pursuing a complementary program studying the internal structure of the nucleon through meson photoproduction at very high photon energies.  The NA59 collaboration has developed techniques for producing and analyzing the degree of polarization of circularly polarized photon beams that can provide valuable direct information on the beam polarization at LEGS and Jlab.  Conversely, the polarized target technology developed for LEGS can significantly enhance the CERN program.  The theoretical input provided by the researchers in South Africa spans both energy regions and will be a valuable aid in data analysis and the design of new experiments.

Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging will be used to  determine either the velocity profile or the velocity spectrum of  a fluid flowing through a tube.  The velocity profile is combined  with an auxiliary measurement, such as pressure drop, to calculate  the viscosity as a function of shear rate.  The velocity profile  technique will be used to determine the shear viscosity of a wide  range of materials.  The researchers will also work with an  equipment manufacturer to develop a prototype instrument based on  the velocity spectrum method.       The instrument developed will have an advantage over  commercially available equipment which either make measurements  over a single shear rate, require considerable time to make  measurements at multiple shear rates, and/or cannot generally  handle filled systems.  The work to be performed here is important  for process control and product analysis of materials like  thermoplastics, both filled and unfilled, dense slurries and  foodstuffs.",56|0308000,Engineering-Mechanical|Industrial Technology,Michael,J,McCarthy,Lowell,J,Burnett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mjmccarthy@ucdavis.edu                                                          ,1994,176619,

Weekly lectures on advanced topics in materials science and physics are also planned, as are opportunities for students to improve their communication skills through presentations on their work.   Once accepted into the program, but prior to arrival at ISU, REU students will be assigned to work in pairs with one or two specific faculty mentors. Assignments will be based on prior student experience and communications between students and mentors. Each pair of REU students will spend almost all of their time working with faculty mentors on a specific research project.   Brigham Young University Idaho (BYUI) and the College of Southern Idaho (CSI) will serve as partner institutions in these activities.

More and more nuclear-theory groups are  turning to the problem of how to calculate the structure of  finite nuclei microscopically, mainly in terms of extremely  large model spaces.  Our research group was one of the first  to become involved in this renewed interest in microscopic  nuclear-structure calculations, our approach being one of  constructing the best possible interaction to employ in the  chosen model space.  This has led us to work in a large  model space, in which all the nuclear particles (i.e.,  nucleons) are active.  So far this approach has been  extremely successful in describing microscopically the  properties of nuclei with two to ten nucleons.  We plan to  extend this approach to nuclei with up to 16 nucleons or  even larger.  Extremely large nuclei with more than 100  nucleons, which cannot be investigated by the above  approach, will be studied using a model in terms of pairs of  nucleons, instead of individual nucleons.

Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the  structure and reaction mechanisms at very low collision energies of neutron- and proton-rich light nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability.. Much of the work is related to the synthesis of elements in normal stars, as well as in supernova explosions and other extreme astrophysical environments. The work primarily will be done at the University of Notre Dame and will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, together  with faculty members and students from several other (primarily undergraduate) colleges and universities, most located in the Midwest . As in the past, the proposed work will have applications in other areas using nuclear technology  including medicine and national security..

At MIT-BATES measurements are                         proposed of the gamma-ray angular correlation when electrons                    are scattered from protons inelastically with the emission of a                 gamma-ray at the (e,e) resonance region of the nucleon.  At                     TRIUMF and IUCF, inelastic proton scattering studies will be                    continued, with gamma-rays detected in coincidence with the                     scattered protons.  In addition, at IUCF, measurements will be                  made of the differential cross sections and analyzing powers                    for the intermediate energy proton capture reaction.  This                      experimental program is based on the use of a very large                        sodium-iodide scintillator spectrometer which has been                          optimized for high-resolution detection of gamma-rays in the                    energy range up to about 500 MeV.

The central thrust of NPL research is                      electromagnetic nuclear physics (EMNP); i.e., electron                          scattering and photoreactions.  Smaller programs of anti-proton                 annihilation studies using CERN facilities and of accelerator                   physics are also being conducted.                                                    MUSL-II provides continuous wave electron beams at                         energies up to 100 MeV for use in electro-and photo-induced                     coincidence reaction studies, primarily related to nuclear                      structure.  Following conclusion of MUSL-II research                            activities, a program of full user mode EMNP research will be                   conducted, principally at the MIT/Bates, University of                          Saskatchewan, and CEBAF electron accelerators, aimed generally                  at sub-nuclear degrees of freedom (nucleons, mesons, and                        quarks).                                                                             Instrumentation development is an important function at                    the NPL.  Large scale equipment construction projects will be                   undertaken in support of the user program and including                         detectors, electronics, spectrometers, specialized targets,                     polarized electron sources, and related equipment.

In (1), the method of  QCD sum rules will be used for the determination of hadronic  properties.  For the nucleon, studies will include the axial  coupling constant, the neutron-proton mass difference and the  parity-violating nuclear interaction.  Weak hyperon decays will  be calculated.  For heavy-light mesons vector-pseudoscalar mass  differences and leptonic decay constants are being determined  including both perturbative and nonperturbative QCD.  Extensions  of the QCD sum rule method will be studied using nonlocal  condensates for quark distributions.  The transition from  nonperturbative to perturbative QCD will be studied in light-cone  Bethe-Salpeter models of pion and nucleon elastic form factors.  Studies of quark cluster structure of nuclei, and properties of  hadrons in nuclear matter will also be carried out.       In (2), a major study of nucleon Compton scattering,  recently completed, will be extended to other areas.  Extensive  calculations of nucleon electroexcitation using light-front  particle dynamics will proceed.  Earlier treatments of deuteron  electromagnetic processes will be extended to different kinematic  regimes, including quasi-elastic electrodisintegration and  photodisintegration.  A new study of nucleon Compton scattering  will proceed.  ***",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Leonard,S,Kisslinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kissling@andrew.cmu.edu                                                         ,1994,186919,

The overall goal of the project is to strengthen student understanding of molecular structure through use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as an essential method for obtaining structural information.  With the revised curriculum, students are developing expertise using NMR through a systematic introduction to NMR theory and concepts.  Furthermore, the vertical integration in lab courses is allowing students to build on previous experiences with NMR to develop increasingly richer understanding of molecular structure.   This new laboratory curriculum is being assessed using the ""Perspectives of Chemists"" framework, a set of tools designed by previously supported NSF initiatives.  This framework divides chemistry into overarching ideas that permeate the curriculum and allows for assessing the progression of student understanding around these ""perspectives"".  Applying these classroom curriculum models to the laboratory setting represents a new extension of the framework.   By explicitly demonstrating the use of NMR in practical applications and by allowing hands on access to the instrument, students are gaining insight into chemical problem solving and confidence in their abilities to gather, analyze, and interpret structural features of molecules.

Emphasis is placed on nuclear systems both finite and infinite.  Our efforts will focus on the utilization of the framework of the self-consistent Green's function method (SCGF) to correlate large amounts of experimental data with the goal to make reliable predictions for nuclei with neutron number N very different from proton number Z that will be studied at future radioactive beam facilities. The SCGF method will also be employed for ab initio, microscopic prediction of the properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. Quantitative microscopic description of nuclear systems, including neutron stars, nuclear matter, and finite nuclei, is the core purpose of the program.    The mentoring of graduate assistants in the process and ethic of scientific research is an integral part of the project. Their contributions are critical to its success. Their development toward independence as original and productive scientists is a central objective of the program, a significant component being the integration of research training with meaningful experience in teaching.

Genetic and molecular                  traits shared by pm and various bacterial mutators are consistent               with the pm gene encoding a topoisomerase, helicase, or polymerase              that functions within the chloroplast (cp).  Another possibility is             that absence of the pm-product increases levels of error-prone                  repair of cpDNA.  Experiments to differentiate among these                      alternatives include chemical mutagenesis treatments of pm seeds,               where a synergistic response to a number of mutagens will indicate              a general defect in a component of cpDNA repair.  Determination of              the extent of slipped strand mispairing in the pm isolates will                 show the likelihood that a defective helicase or topoisomerase is               involved.  Other experiments are designed to locate the sites of                existing pm-mutations, and to isolate new pm-mutations in the rbcL              gene.  Sequence data from these sites will indicate whether pm                  causes base substitutions, small deletions, or other alterations,               as well as sizeable deletions observed in other, non-coding regions             of cpDNA and occurring between short direct repeats.                                                                                                            In addition to providing insights into the molecular events that                result in the mutation of cpDNA, these investigations are pertinent             to the history of the cpDNA molecule, which, in an evolutionary                 time frame, has experienced frequent deletions, insertions and                  inversions mediated by short direct repeats.***",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Barbara,B,Sears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sears@msu.edu                                                                   ,1991,197056,

To date, it has not been feasible to isolate the elements of mitochondrion-nucleus communication in plants.  The missing component has been an easily scorable trait for mitochondrial function, one responsive to environmental signals.  Plant mitochondria have a branched respiratory pathway with an alternative oxidase (AOX) not coupled to proton translocation and ATP synthesis.  Cold, wounding,  Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and pathogen attack, among others, increase alternative oxidase activity and  Aox gene expression. AOX, in the laboratory, is also a dispensable activity in plants, thus its levels may be genetically modified and potential mutants lacking AOX activity recovered.  Our research is centered around the isolation of mutants in mitochondrion-nucleus signaling using AOX expression to score for mitochondrial function.  We have devised a visual screen for impaired AOX induction after challenge by oxidative stress. To complement this screen, we use microarray analysis to further characterize the mutants, and to identify genes and gene clusters involved in stress-induced AOX expression.  Preliminary microarray experiments on mitochondrial gene expression in Arabidopsis leaves establish that this approach can be successful.  [Initial data are available online: http://genome www4.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD under experimenter ""McIntosh""] To ensure complete coverage of the genome we will use oligoarrays, cDNA arrays and directed ""mitochondrial"" arrays.  Mutants in conjunction with transgenic plants will be used to decipher mitochondrial involvement in oxidative stress signaling and cell death, and the role of AOX in the hypevirulence response.  AOX and ROS involvement in cell death will be studied through cytochrome c gene family (At-Cc) expression, cytochrome c levels in the mitochondrion and cytosol, and  cytochrome pathway activity.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Jianping, ,Yu,Lee, ,McIntosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yujianpi@msu.edu                                                                ,2001,198080,

A new regenerative NQR                        spectrometer yields boron signals of about 100 at 1 MHz and                     permits measurements down to 200 kHz.  The new NQR results allow                the quadrupole coupling and asymmetry parameters to be determined               to better than 1%, more than an order of magnitude better than                  from NMR spectra.  NQR spectroscopy is yielding highly accurate                 values of these parameters in crystals and glasses, which should                permit a positive identification of the structural groupings in                 borate binary glasses.  Extensions to terniary glass systems are                also planned.  There are also plans to extend the work to                       aluminum nuclei to accurately determine the electric field                      gradient tensors at the aluminum site to ascertain the symmetry,                coordination, and chemical bonding of the aluminum.",13|0106000,Physics|Materials Research,Philip,J,Bray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1990,200387,

The current NMR spectroscope has limited application as a detector for microseparations because of its relatively poor sensitivity.  The new cells will employ specially designed RF microcoils that will be used in flowing analytical separation while retaining the full NMR capability for structural determination.  This enables the cells to analyze mass-limited and volume-limited samples of chemical species.   The overall goal of this research is to create a new generation of optimized nanoliter volume NMR detection cells for commercialization for liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis microseparation studies.,0110000|12,Technology Transfer|Chemistry,Timothy,L,Peck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1995,200767,

The  school would bring together leading researchers to lecture  on their specialties to advanced graduate students in  experimental and theoretical nuclear physics.  The overall  goal of the schools is to provide students with a reference  frame for defining critical problems of nuclear physics and  the most useful methods of analysis of the problems.  This  addresses one weakness in the current nuclear research  environment, which is the relative isolation of university-  based nuclear research groups.  We also expect that the  close contact with leading researchers will be beneficial in  increasing the number of students going on to productive  research careers.  ***",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,George,F,Bertsch,Wick,C,Haxton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bertsch@phys.washington.edu                                                     ,1995,204161,

The two groups will collaborate               on new experiments at intermediate energy particle accelerators at              the two laboratories.  By measuring observables which depend upon               the spin of the outgoing particles scattered from targets such as               carbon-12 and calcium-48 the experimenters will determine the                   spectrum of nuclear continuum states which can be excited only by a             transfer of spin to the nucleus.

Research topics include neutrino oscillation studies, ultra-cold neutron research, and ultra-high energy cosmic ray studies. Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students is integrated throughout the program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in these frontier areas of nuclear physics and astrophysics . Neutrino oscillations will be addressed by a new experimental project to study the remaining unknown mixing angle q13 by measuring the disappearance of antineutrinos from a nuclear power plant. During this grant period this new project should begin construction. We will also embark on a new experimental program utilizing novel techniques to produce and study ultra-cold neutrons. These neutrons are converted to very cold temperatures where they can be trapped for long periods of time, enabling very precise measurements of their properties. The first experiment will study the violation of mirror symmetry in the decay of ultra-cold neutrons. We will also perform research and development towards a new experiment to determine the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which should begin construction during this grant period. Theoretical studies related to these experimental efforts are also part of this program.

Research problems include the study of the evolution of foams, their structures and the time dependence of their rheology;  the flow of liquids including foams in porous media; the imaging of flow in concentrated suspensions and their properties; the architecture of neural network as a source of information for the mathematical modeling of these networks; hibernating myocardium and fumarate reductase as a study of anaerobiosis and metabolic alteration; the design of selective MRI contrast agents and studies of tissue freezing and cryoprotectant distribution as a metabolic response.  The results obtained from these studies will support the research of the OLISAO program in the Department of Electrical Engineering which develops theory and numerical simulations to fit and process image signals.  These studies vary from theoretical to applied and form engineering design to neurobiology.  The support from LISA will aid in developing improved imaging technology and increase speed and accuracy in processing of data into images.  The proposed studies either require static imaging of prepared samples or study of the changes of images in time.    These projects can all be adequately performed with a vertical, high resolution NMR imagine spectrometer operating at 300 MHz (7 Tesla magnetic field) with the necessary accessories to acquire and process data.  The in-vivo probe (64mm working diameter) will monitor 1H at gradient strengths of 20 G/cm (at 40 A), suitable for high resolution 3-d imaging experiments on frog and for large scale hydrodynamics experiments.  The microimaging probe will be available with 0.4 cm to 2.5 cm coils for various nuclei, with microprobes for microimaging at a resolution below 100 um for use in high resolution materials science and bioc hemistry experiments.  Some of the hardware and software will require custom design for individual experiments.  Three NMR specialists will be present in the NMR facility, one devoted solely to MRI and one with extensive MRI experience, to provide support for experiment development and execution.    The current proposal includes 10 faculty, 5 postdoctoral, 12 graduate students and 5 undergraduate researchers.  MRI will also be used in undergraduate courses with an enrollment of about 65 and graduate courses with an annual enrollment of about 25.  ***",56|0308000|53,Engineering-Mechanical|Industrial Technology|Engineering-Chemical,James,A,Glazier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,glazier@indiana.edu                                                             ,1996,211172,

Such miniaturization and implementation of NMR systems on a micro-fluidic platform will lead to the highly parallel chemical analysis of smaller volumes of bio-chemically important solutions with significantly greater sensitivity than previously possible. Reducing the size of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) devices on a chip will also lead to the non-destructive imaging of biological cells with an unprecedented spatial resolution.  Intellectual Merit Micro-fluidic chip-based NMR systems will be designed and fabricated implementing (a) components for application of large gradient magnetic fields, (b) permanent magnet-based devices that provide high local fields, and (c) micro/nanometer scale electro-magnetic coils that will significantly improve the sensitivity and resolution of NMR and MRI.  This research will offer new tools for the study of individual cells, enabling both spectroscopic and imaging observation of changes in cell metabolism triggered by the micro-fluidic controlled environmental changes. Furthermore, the micro-fluidic NMR chips will provide the ability to manipulate pico-liters of solution and perform highly parallel NMR biochemical analysis. Fundamental limits of miniaturization and integration of NMR micro-technologies within the elastomeric micro-fluidic chips will also be explored.  Broader Impact This program will foster collaboration between a Ph.D. granting institution (Caltech) and a large, urban, minority serving non-Ph.D. granting university (CSULB). The Ph.D. and Masters students from both institutions will be exposed to the multi-disciplinary techniques from engineering, physics, and biochemistry, while being trained in micro-fabrication, fluidics, sensor design, and magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The research that students perform is expected to find many other applications where small samples have to be analyzed and imaged within an inexpensive portable chip-based platform with particular emphasis towards disease diagnostics.

Although it had been demonstrated, by hybridization                             experiments, that the nuclear genomes of many plants contain                    sequences derived from the chloroplast genome, this is the                      first example of the physical isolation of such integrates.                     Our analysis of the integrates and of the integration sites                     suggests the involvement of homologous recombination                            mechanisms in the transposition events.  In this proposal we                    outline experiments designed to physically isolate and                          characterize many chloroplast DNA integrates in the tomato                      nuclear genome.  The date obtained will be used to test the                     hypothesis that homologous recombination is involved in the                     transposition of such chloroplast sequences into the nuclear                    genome.                                                                                                                                                         The presence of DNA sequences integrated into the cellular                      genome which originated in the organelle genomes has been                       abundantly documented.  However, little or nothing is known                     about the mechanism(s) involved.

The research makes use of the large gamma ray  detector array, Gammasphere, which is presently located at  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  During the period of  this grant this facility will be moved to the ATLAS facility  at Argonne National Laboratory to take advantage of other  beams available there.  Using NSF funds, the Rochester group  has constructed a 4-pi charged particle detector (Compact  Heavy Ion Counter) which can be used together with  Gammasphere to considerably enhance its utility for these  measurements.  Partial support will be provided by the MPS  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), as part of an  enabling initiative in instrumentation development, to  provide for the modifications needed to CHICO in order to  use it at ATLAS and for needed computer hardware for data  analysis.  The Rochester group will continue using the  methods already developed in their past research to exploit  these new opportunities.

The emphasis of this proposal is reaction dynamics over a range of beam energies, from intermediate ( > 10 AMeV) to ultra-relativistic (100 AGeV). Particular attention is paid to theory that is relevant to exper- iments at the NSCL, GSI, CERN-SPS, and RHIC. The co-PIs have a long tradition of collaborating with experimental groups in the US and abroad, and they will continue to do so. Thematically, themain emphasis lies on the investigation of correlations between emitted particles, as well as phase transitions in heavy ion reactions at different energy regimes. An important component of this proposal is the theoretical support for the future Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) program and its connection to nuclear astrophysics. Since the RIA construction was identifed as the highest priority in theNSAC long-range plan, it is impera- tive to deepen the theoretical underpinning for this feld. The proposed topics are of present interest to the investigators in light of the present experimental situation. A traditional strength of the investi- gators is the ability to adapt their research directions to new experimental fndings, and it can be predicted that this will continue during the proposed grant period. Almost all of the funds proposed will be spent for salaries for two gradu- ate students and one post-doctoral associate. In year one, there is a request for some computer support. This is justifed, because almost all proposed research makes extensive use of numerical work.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Pawel, ,Danielewicz,Wolfgang,W,Bauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,danielewicz@nscl.msu.edu                                                        ,2003,215336,

In their experiments a target bound                 nucleon is first knocked out to an unbound orbit.  The nucleon                  may then escape from the target (knockout) or be recaptured by                  the target (knockout-fusion).  In previous research the                         collaborators have developed a theoretical approach to evaluate                 the cross sections of these inelastic nuclear reactions, fitting                well some of the available data.  In the present research, they                 will improve the theory so that inelastic cross sections may be                 calculated in both bound and unbound regions on the same basis.                                                                                                 Having developed the theoretical basis for understanding                        knockout-fusion nuclear processes, the collaborators will                       introduce the necessary modifications, and Dr. Kim will develop                 a computer program for carrying out numerical calculations.                     This computer program will be installed on the Cray X-MP                        computer at the University of Texas and tested.  Actual                         calculations will be made by researchers at the University of                   Texas.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                       U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase                  the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                 engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.

ZnGeP2 single crystals have the highest figure of merit for use in optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) to generate 3 to 11 micron tunable radiation. However, ZnGeP2 shows an anomalous absorption between 1 and 3 microns, which is the desired spectral region for pumping OPOs. This absorption sharply limits the average power that can be handled by IR OPOs. Although we have found that thermal annealing of ZnGeP2 crystals will improve the optical transmission from 1 to 3 microns, the improvement is not great enough, and it requires an excessive annealing time. INRAD, Inc., proposes to utilize fast electron and gamma ray radiation to improve the optical transmission of ZnGeP2.

This group will play a pivotal role in an approved experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) designed to measure the electric form factor of the neutron as a function of momentum transfer. Because the neutron is overall neutral, the electric form factor is very sensitive to the details of the constituents and their motions. This measurement provides one of the best experimental tests available for any model of the nucleon and is generally considered to be one of the most important measurements to be performed in intermediate-energy nuclear physics. The experiment will be performed by the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from a liquid deuterium target and detecting the knock-out neutron in coincidence with the scattered electron. The Kent State group has the responsibility for providing the neutron detector array for this experiment. The array consists of thirty-six separate neutron detectors arranged so as to both detect the neutron and determine its spin. The transfer of the spin from the electron beam to the neutron is directly related to the charge form factor of the neutron. The detector array is called a neutron polarimeter. The Kent State group has used a similar polarimeter in experiments at other accelerator facilities and will have the responsibility for the installation, operation, and maintenance of this detector array for the experiment. This project will be part of the Ph.D. dissertation research of two Kent State graduate students. 	Support from this award will also enable this group to finish the analysis of experiments performed at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility to study the spin dependence of the nuclear force, to search for three-body contributions to the nuclear force, and also to analyze measurements of baryon resonances using the Crystal Ball Spectrometer at the Brookhaven AGS accelerator. These measurements were performed with earlier support from the National Science Foundation and are part of the dissertation projects of three Kent State graduate students. ",,,Bryon,D,Anderson,D.

The aim is to  gain a comprehensive and profound understanding of nuclei in  regions of the N-Z landscape which are vital to our  understanding the evolution of the universe and which have  yet proven inaccessible to laboratories on earth.  The  common thread is to build from the fundamental shell model,  the ""standard model"" in nuclear structure physics.  Specific  research directions include the development of the Drexel  University Shell-Model (DUSM) code as a numerical  implementation of the shell model; the Fermion Dynamical  Symmetry Model (FDSM) to study the collective aspects of  larger nuclei; a pseudo-spin pseudo-orbit model which aims  at a ""grand unification"" of low- and high-spin spectroscopy;  the projected shell-model, as well as a generalized pair  shell-model, to enhance our understanding of high-spin  physics and the collective behavior of nuclei; and the mean-  field Hartree-Fock approach, which addresses the global  properties of nuclei.  ***",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Michel, ,Vallieres,Da-Hsuan, ,Feng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vallieres@einstein.drexel.edu                                                   ,1995,221361,

The NMR  data  will  be  combined with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) results  to  be  generated through a collaboration with colleagues at  the  University of Colorado.  This comprehensive approach will be used  to  advance  a theoretical modeling approach that will contribute  to  the understanding of molecular conformations and interactions  on  the  phase  behavior of liquid crystals, and perhaps  to  the  formulation of new low-viscosity nematic mixtures.  %%%  The  synthesis and properties of new liquid crystal  systems  are  playing  an increasingly important role in advancing a number  of  applications  areas that include new materials for  infrared  and  microwave  liquid  crystal modulators, and fast-switching  liquid  crystal  displays.   Furthermore, since  the  phase  behavior  of  liquid  crystal mixtures formulated to optimize certain materials  properties is often complicated and unpredictable, the  focus  of  these  studies  should advance significantly  the  use  of  these  systems for industrial uses.  ***",0106000,Materials Research,Bing,M,Fung,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bmfung@ou.edu                                                                   ,1997,221479,

Several new experiments are proposed, many of which require use of a modern FT-NMR spectrometer.  These experiments enhance laboratory skills and critical thinking with regard to: (1) stereochemical concepts, (2) chemical dynamics, (3) structure determination, (4) synthetic methodologies, and (5) molecular modeling.    The upgraded FT-NMR plays a vital role in these experiments. Development of these experiments involves four faculty and between ten and twenty undergraduate students over the two year period of the grant.  The goal of this project is to implement a new, interdisciplinary advanced laboratory course for senior chemistry majors. Other existing courses benefit through modernization of the FT NMR spectrometer.  A significant filter-down effect of lab experiments and student expertise (as lab TA's) also enhances the lower-level courses.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Matthew,A,Kubasik,Thomas,K,Green,Lester         ,L,Pesterfield,Robert         ,W,Holman,,,,,,,,,,mkubasik@fairfield.edu                                                          ,1998,221587,

Solutions to such problems include generation of additional data                sets, greater taxon sampling density, comprehensive review of the               fossil record,and critical analysis of the various data sets                    individually and in combination.  For this purpose, regions of DNA              exhibiting levels of divergence appropriate for phylogenetic                    resolution at the familial, subfamilial and sectional levels will               be sought.   Sequences from both nuclear and chloroplast genomes                will be produced for representative members of the family and                   proposed outgroup taxa.  Analysis of data is to be conducted                    independently but also coupled with different data sets.

This equipment will enhance research on a number of   projects ranging from synthesis of natural products and other   biologically active compounds to elucidation of reaction mechanisms,   transition metal chemistry, organometallic chemistry, catalysis, and   development of reagents for stereocontrolled synthesis.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.

Research on heavy-ion collisions ranges from studies of the nuclear equation of state to the developing area of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.  The emphasis in astrophysics is on applying nuclear theory to neutron stars and nuclear reaction in the cosmos, with the aim of explaining observations and using observations to learn the properties of matter.

The experimental program is designed to take advantage of the neutron production capabilities at the University's accelerator facility and the unique detection capabilities that have been developed in this laboratory.  Nuclear structure studies are primarily oriented toward exploring multiphonon vibrational excitations in nearly spherical nuclei, examining new types of nuclear excitations, defining the roles of protons and neutrons in collective modes, and understanding nuclear shell structure and the nature of nuclear shape transitions.  Nuclear level lifetime measurements with the Doppler-shift attenuation method and gamma-gamma coincidence measurements, for which the methodologies have been developed in our laboratory, will play crucial roles in many of these studies. Carefully selected experiments in other areas which are particularly appropriate to the capabilities and facilities at the accelerator laboratory will be pursued.   Education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels continues to be an integral part of all activities in our laboratory.  Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and graduates emerge as well-prepared nuclear scientists.  For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as to scientists from other research universities and national laboratories, and research collaborations are encouraged.  These colleagues frequently take advantage of our unique facilities to obtain information that may be crucial for the design of experiments at larger laboratories or in other areas of physics.  Research performed in our laboratory is directly applicable to problems of national interest and homeland security.  These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment.

The motivation lies in applications to few-body physics where  predictions of realistic models can be accurately computed and the results compared to complete experimental measurements.  We will continue to concentrate on meson exchange as the  useful and economic model of three-nucleon interactions and of the small but interesting breaking of 'charge symmetry' in the two-nucleon interaction.  We will explore the theoretical similarities between this approach to three-nucleon forces and the production of mesons from the collision of two nucleons.  Some new experiments study charge symmetry breaking in meson production; the similarities proposed and explored in this project might help our understanding of these experiments.  Although our models and methods utilize meson exchange, the ultimate source of charge symmetry breaking lies in the different masses of the subunits of the nucleons called quarks.  We will continue field theoretical calculations at the quark level of meson properties due to quark mass differences, and compare with new experimental information on 'meson mixing' to provide a firmer basis for our models of 'charge asymmetry' in both the nucleon-nucleon interaction but also the less well known lambda-nucleon interaction.  We also will continue our studies of the neutron which are guided by the Dirac equation.

The research program fea-tures two central themes, namely 1) The structure and interactions of nucleons and nuclei; and 2) Tests of fundamental symmetries and the standard model. Specific activities include the estab-lished international experiments: G0, HERMES, PHENIX, RCS, Muon g-2,  Lan, and  Cap.  Additionally, the group has a local feasibility effort in hydrogen atomic parity violation (H-APV) and is helping to develop a new neutron electric dipole moment (n-EDM) experiment.  The goal of all of these experiments is to help answer important questions in subatomic physics.  For ex-ample, in G0, HERMES, RCS and the PHENIX spin program, a common query is ""How is the proton built?"" The experiments use different tools such as parity-violating electron scattering, polarized electron-nucleon scattering, real Compton scattering, and polarized proton-proton col-lisions to discover the roles that constituent quarks, sea quarks and gluons (the partons) play to result in the well-known properties of the proton.  The experiments should help settle the debate about how the proton obtains its half-integer spin.  They will also shed light on the relative im-portance of different types of quarks inside the proton revealing, for example, how strange quarks contribute to the proton's charge and magnetic structure.   In the PHENIX program at RHIC, deuteron-nuclei collisions will also be studied to investigate the role that partons play in nuclei.  The Muon g-2, H-APV, and n-EDM activities are all aimed at the second theme, asking the question ""Is the current standard model correct?""  The most mature of these efforts, g-2, has already provided exciting and suggestive evidence that some type of standard model extension might be required. Completion of this effort and possible extensions will provide either a very stringent limit on new physics or, alternatively, a strong indication that it must be present.  Other precision measurements of fundamental parameters are featured in the ULan and UCap experi-ments.  The first of these will determine the muon lifetime to a precision of one part per million, which can then be interpreted as a 20-fold improvement in the determination of the weak interac-tion strength.  The second experiment will accurately measure the least-well-known weak form factor (gP) of the proton.  This will provide a stringent test of precise theoretical predictions founded on basic symmetries of strong interactions at low energies. In addition to direct physics research out-comes, the group has reached beyond the laboratory to make significant contributions to educa-tion and outreach and will continue to do so.  Research projects contribute substantially to the education of a large number of postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students.

The program emphasizes frontier issues in nuclear structure physics (smooth band termination, physics near the proton drip line near A=3D100, M1 excitations, superdeformed and other large deformation shapes in the A=3D80 region, and the competition between particle and gamma-ray emission at the limits of stability).  Another venue of research utilizes the decay of giant resonances to study properties of nuclear matter (nuclear dissipation, superconducting-to-liquid drop phase transition, nu-clear compressibility as a function of temperature). Another component of the program proposes to continue preparations for a test of the electroweak interaction (parity non-conservation in Fr atoms).  A more suitable Francium laboratory will be prepared in order to perform atomic physics measurements with great accuracy (Stark-induced 7s  --> 8s transition and hyperfine anomaly measurements).  The Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory also serves as a focus of many educational activities. Students at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels participate in the research program with various intensities, from beam line construction to running actual experiments.

The main goal is to use the precision and versatility of the electron probe to study the structure of matter. The energy of the accelerator allows us to 'see' matter at distances where phenomena are governed by the strong nuclear force. Experiments are carefully designed to gain insight into the quark structure and dynamics of nuclear matter. This is a contemporary field of research that uses recent technological advances in the production of electron beams and nuclear targets coupled with specially designed detection systems.  At the Bates Center we conduct experiments with multiple magnetic spectrometers capable of making high precision measurements to advance the science. We are also involved in the construction of a new detector,the Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST). Up to date information in the development of these projects can be found at http://mitbates.mit.edu. Our research program under this grant  provides an excellent environment for the educational development of students and postdoctoral personnel.

It  includes basic studies of the quark-gluon plasma, hadron  structure, nuclear forces, the structure of nuclei, nuclear  and hadronic matter.  A wide range of electron-nucleus and  hadron-nucleus and hadron-nucleus scattering experiments and  heavy-ion collisions are analyzed in conjunction with these  basic studies.  The emphasis in astrophysics is on  understanding neutron star structure and evolution, low-  energy nuclear reactions, and the effect of phase  transitions in the early universe.  Fundamental problems in  the theory of quantum liquids, quantum liquid drops,  superconductivity and superfludity are also studied.  ***",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Gordon,A,Baym,D.

This structure is found in the headpiece of mammalian sperm and appears to be the excess vestments of the nuclear envelope after compaction of the nucleus during sperm development.  Although the RNE has been considered by many to be merely a waste product, preliminary evidence suggests it is a calcium storage site which releases calcium to hyperactivate sperm in the female oviduct.  This idea is supported by the close proximity of the envelope to the flagellar base and the mitochondrion in the sperm head where the signal for flagellar beating arises.  In addition, immunofluorescence light microscopy has revealed that inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptors are found in the region of the RNE.  When activated, IP3 receptors in other cell systems normally cause release of calcium from intracellular stores. Two specific objectives are proposed for this project to substantiate this function of the RNE.  As the first objective, immunogold electron microscopy will be used to demonstrate unequivocally that IP3 receptors are located on the membranes of the RNE.  As the second objective, well characterized pharmacological agents will be employed to cause intracellular calcium release in order to analyze the role of internal calcium, presumably from the RNE, in control of sperm activation.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Susan,S,Suarez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sss7@cornell.edu                                                                ,1999,245330,

Simple problems concerning  polymer modification chemistry and copolymerization chemistry will  be explored initially to allow the nuclear magnetic resonance  techniques to be perfected and to provide experience in their  application.  Later, more complex problems will be investigated.   The studies will be conducted by Professor Peter Rinaldi whose  specialty is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Professor  H. James Harwood jointly whose specialty is in synthesizing  polymers and applying chemical and physical techniques to problems  of polymer microstructure characterization.  New nuclear magnetic  resonance techniques developed in Professor Rinaldl's laboratory  will permit selective observation of structurally important polymer  fragments, and will permit extraction of long-range structural  information not previously obtainable by other means.  These  techniques are ideally suited for polymer characterization studies  that require the detection of labeled nuclei that are present in  low concentration in these polymers.    It is expected that these studies will bring forth new information  on detailed polymer structure as a function of polymerization   method.  ***",0106000|12,Materials Research|Chemistry,Peter,L,Rinaldi,H.

Particular effort is being directed                  at the problem of accurately calculating quantum corrections to                 the mean field equations and identifying signatures of such                     corrections in experimental data.  The problem of correctly                     incorporating the pion into quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), where                  the fundamental constituents are taken as baryons and mesons,                   is also a major objective.  This problem is closely related to                  the calculation of quantum corrections, and it provides a                       vehicle for exploring several nonperturbative approaches.

Fragments of  nuclei after reactions with energetic pi mesons  will be measured with a reliable and efficient  detector system that requires a very time-  consuming and careful analysis.  The exposure  to the requisite pion beams will be carried out  in an optimal manner, in coordination with  skilled analysts in Pakistan.  The nuclear  excitation energy will be at levels where  traditional nuclear fission is preempted by  fast fragment production.  Nuclear targets of  middle mass will be selected to minimize the  role of fission in its traditional sense.    Scope:  The project involves Dr. R.J. Peterson,  from the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the  University of Colorado, in Boulder, and a  Pakistani team headed by Dr. Hameed Ahmed Khan,  of the Solid State Nuclear Track Detector  Laboratory in PINSTECH, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.   The proposed work is part of a U.S.-Brazil-  Pakistan collaboration in the study of pion-  induced fission.  Past collaboration has  resulted in U.S. publication using data from  Pakistan and calculations from Boulder. This  grant is the first for the P.I. for the purpose  of enhancing this collaboration, and it meets  the criteria of the Division of International  Programs.  ***",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Roy,J,Peterson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,peterson@spectr.colorado.edu                                                    ,1994,251812,

This project focuses on nuclear genes that determine the level of expression of a specific chloroplast gene:  the rbcL gene that encodes the large subunit of the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO).  The study will exploit the unique genetic and molecular genetic properties of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  We have developed a strong positive selection for RuBisCO-deficient mutants in C. reinhardtii and will generate a large collection of nuclear gene mutants that fail to produce RuBisCO, but produce normal amounts of other chloroplast gene products.  These mutants will be characterized genetically (by dominance and allelism tests) and mechanistically through molecular studies of rbcL expression.  Preliminary studies on one such mutant, 24DD, suggest that its rbcL mRNA is unstable does not support adequate large subunit synthesis.  Experiments are proposed to confirm and extend these results, to identify and characterize the cis-acting target in the rbcL mRNA that  distinguishes it from other chloroplast messages that are not destabilized in the mutant, and to initiate the cloning and characterization of the mutant gene and its wild type allele.  %%%  The RuBisCO enzyme, whose gene control is under study in this project, is known to be one of the most important elements that limits photosynthetic efficiency, water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency in plants.  Eventual success in correcting of these limitations will depend not only upon understanding its biochemical and metabolic properties but also upon understanding how it's biosynthesis is controlled by the plant.  This project will make a major contribution to that understanding.  ***",61|0000099,Life Science Biological|Other Applications NEC,Laurens,J,Mets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mets@uchicago.edu                                                               ,1995,255701,

These users represent  various departments on campus (Biochemistry and Biophysics,  Chemistry, Agricultural Chemistry, and Pharmacy), making the  requested instrument a truly interdisciplinary resource.  The research groups are divided into two groups:  (1) Major  Users (six) who have research projects that require a  commitment of instrument time on a 500 MHz spectrometer to  study aspects of solution-state dynamics, kinetics and /or  structure function relationships of biologically interesting  molecules; (2) Minor Users (six) who have research projects  in which NMR spectroscopy is not a primary research tool,  but can be used to provided valuable data and insight that  is not easily obtainable by other methods.  The projects  that require this new instrumentation include:  structural  and dynamics studies of DNA-binding proteins and their  interactions with DNA; determining the solution structures  of DNA uracil glycosylase, its inhibitor, and the enzyme-  inhibitor complex; detailed structural studies of marine  natural products and antibiotics; identifying specific sites  of covalent modification of enzymes by highly specific  inactivators; and using oxygen isotope- induced carbon  resonance frequency shifts to study the extent of repair in  aging proteins.    The 500 MHz instrument requested in this proposal will  complement the existing equipment in the Departments of  Biochemistry and Biophysics, Chemistry, Agricultural  Chemistry, and Pharmacy.

A central hypothesis to be tested here is that defense gene expression in plants is modulated by a phosphorylation-dependent change in the transcriptional activity of G-box binding factors.  Aside from understanding a process of general importance to all higher eukaryotes the proposed studies may ultimately lead to the development of novel and sustainable forms of crop protection.  Changes in the transcription activity of plant GBF's in response to defense cues (eg., nonhost bacterial species or biotic elicitors) cDNA's of these factors will be fused to a novel DNA-binding domain and expressed in plant cells containing a reporter gene.  Changes in the phosphorylation of these chimeric GBF's will be assessed by phosphopeptide mapping.  Protein kinases that phosphorylate GBF's in response to defense stimuli will be biochemically purified to obtain N-terminal sequences for cloning GBF-protein kinase cDNA's.  Cloned putative kinases will be tested in vivo for their ability to phosphorylate GBF and act in defense-signaling.  To identify potential mediators of plant GBF-dependent transcription a far-western screening of plant cDNA expression libraries with labeled GBF as probe will be performed.  Cloned proteins will by functionally characterized by standard protein binding and transfection techniques.  %%%  Higher plants resist microbial infection in part by synthesizing phytoalexins.  The rapid and transient activation of ""defense"" genes that encode for enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis largely determines the timing and magnitude of this response.  Recent evidence suggests that protein kinases couple defense signal perception to enhanced gene expression.  For example, inhibitors of protein kinases block the expression of plant defense genes, whereas agents that stimulate protein kinase activities in other metazoan systems both enhance pla nt defense gene expression and result in the transient phosphorylation of a few cellular proteins.  How plant gene building factors function in signal-dependent transcription is currently unknown but, like in animals, may involve changes in the phosphorylation state of the factor.  ***",61|0201000,Life Science Biological|Agriculture,Jonathan,A,Arias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arias@umbc.edu                                                                  ,1996,265998,

The activities are of an experimental nature and consist of precision measurements of the intrinsic properties of the neutron, such as the search for its electric dipole moment (EDM), the correlation coefficients from the neutron -decay spectrum and the determination of the strength of the hadronic weak interaction.  These measurements are part of a program in fundamental neutron science at the newly completed Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will train young scientists at the postdoctoral level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution.

In the absence of nonperturbative methods for solving QCD, one may formulate an effective field theory (EFT) to describe hadronic and nuclear physics. The basic idea of EFT is to develop a perturbative expansion in ratios of widely separated scales, which are plentiful in hadronic and nuclear systems. The undetermined parameters that appear in this expansion can be fit to data, or constrained using symmetries and large-Nc methods, and ultimately computed using lattice QCD. This methodology has led to a rich interplay between nuclear theory and experiment and is currently indispensable to the extrapolation of unphysical lattice QCD simulations to nature. We propose to develop new links between hadronic and nuclear physics and QCD, and to facilitate the first links between lattice QCD and nuclei, using effective quantum field theories constrained by QCD symmetries. Our objectives are: (i) To further develop the vibrant relationship between nuclear theory and experiment and to continue the pioneering efforts currently underway to understand basic properties of simple nuclei using lattice QCD. We propose to study processes involving external probes of two- and three-body systems at low energies and to investigate the relevance of isospin violation for the extraction of nucleon parameters. The problem of developing a mass-independent regulator - like dimensional regularization - for nuclear EFT will be pursued. We intend to develop an EFT for hypernuclear physics which will aid in describing strange matter and in extracting hypernuclear observables from lattice QCD. Heavy-hadron potentials offer a theoretical laboratory for exploring the intermediate-range nuclear force in lattice QCD. We therefore propose to study the long-distance potential between two heavy mesons and other simple systems using EFT. (ii) To develop new tools to allow extrapolation of forthcoming lattice QCD data. We propose to investigate the role of finite lattice spacing corrections both in the baryon and heavy meson sectors. The role of finite-volume effects will be studied both for the purpose of extrapolating hadronic observables to infinite volume and as a tool to extract S-matrix elements from lattice simulations. (iii) We propose to study the algebraic relevance of chiral symmetry for strange hadrons, including the recently observed ""pentaquark"" and to further understand the role of chiral symmetry in: (a) constraining quark-hadron duality and (b) decrypting the large-Nc structure of the excited mesons and baryons. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a description of hadrons and nuclei that is consistent with QCD and which has a rigorous accounting of theoretical errors. We expect our research to have significant impact, both in bringing nuclear physics into the fold of effective field theories of the standard model, and as part of the global effort to bring hadronic and nuclear physics under theoretical control for the purpose of searching for physics beyond the standard model. This project marks the beginning of a program in nuclear theory at the University of New Hampshire. The universal character of the methodology renders the proposed research ideal for the education of graduate and undergraduate students.

The second will explore                 the electromagnetic structure of those nucleon resonances which                 decay primarily by eta emission, and the difficulties associated                with planned coincidence experiments at the next generation                     facilities.  Design and construction of new detectors are major                 elements of the IUCF experiment, to a lesser extent with the                    Bates work.

In one superfluid phase the neutron and proton are coupled to isospin T = 1 and  intrinsic spin S =0.  In another superfluid phase the neutron and proton are coupled to T = 0 and S = 1.  These phases should be most likely to occur in nuclei which have approximately equal numbers of neutrons and protons.  There are also superfluid phases in which each Cooper pair is composed of two neutrons or two protons.  These pairs have T = 1 and S = 0.  All of these different superfluid phases can co-exist in the same nucleus and in the same wave-function.  Calculations on medium mass nuclei near the N = Z line will search for these exotic np superfluids.  Calculations will determine how the np superfluids depend on neutron excess N - Z, temperature, and spin.  The project will investigate transitions in the shapes of atomic nuclei at high temperatures.  Calculations on medium mass nuclei will search for isotopes where rotation of a hot spherical shape generates a hot prolate shape rotating around its symmetry axis.  These calculations will search for the second critical shape transition temperature at which the prolate shape rotating about its symmetry axis turns into an oblate shape rotating about its symmetry axis.

There are major discrepancies between the results of  calculations of this phenomenon and the available experimental  data.  The various experiments conducted so far have all suffered  from common disadvantages.  They utilized whole spectra of  positrons derived from radioactive sources and thick targets.  Metastable states of the nucleus were studied for periods of a  few life times.  The results were not accurate, and were prone to  ambiguities for interpretation.  In view of this, experiments  have been called for that would use monoenergetic positrons and  thin targets.  Such studies will be undertaken utilizing the  Dynamitron at Brookhaven and at ORELA at Oak Ridge National Lab.  Short-lived states will be studied, that would make a continuous-  running beam experiment possible.  Thin targets of varied  thickness will be used.  Secondary effects that might contribute  to the nuclear excitation alongside the single-quantum  annihilation, proposed by differing theoretical models,  would be  explored.  It is expected that data could be derived that would  be accessible for unambiguous interpretation, and would lead to  a clear understanding of the physical processes underlying the  phenomenon.  ***",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Jose,C,Palathingal,Lester,D,Hulett,Palakkal       , ,Asoka-Kumar,Kelvin         ,G,Lynn,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1995,276014,

This award supports experimental research investigating quantum information using nuclear spin.  In quantum information research, atomic gases have been successfully used in many important applications.  Prior experiments using atomic ensembles stored quantum information in electron spin.  Unfortunately, electron spin is fragile, and information can be easily lost.  On the other hand, nuclear spin is comparatively robust.  This project will develop techniques for entangling photons with a nuclear ensemble and for storing quantum information in nuclear spin.  The project will explore the coherence between photons and nuclei, and use nuclear spin to implement the basic building blocks of ensemble-based quantum information experiments.  The broader impact of this program includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students in cold atom research, quantum information research, and many areas of modern technology, such as lasers, optics, high vacuum, and cryogenics.  The fundamental concepts underlying the research will be disseminated to a wider audience of students using the internet.

In Phase I the Project Director,                          Dr. Ernst Moniz will outline a teaching manual focused on                       modern particle and nuclear physics.  Working from the                          outline three master teachers and the Program Coordinator                       will put together a lecture series program to be delivered by                   research scientists from the Bates Laboratory.  Phase II is                     the lecture series delivered between September 1990 and                         December 1990.  Phase III is to refine the teaching manual                      using participant feedback followed by its distribution to                      teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The core of this project is the teaching manual and its use                     in the in-service sessions.  Because of the lack of current                     material in high school texts regarding modern particle and                     nuclear physics the first section will contain modern                           particle and nuclear physics teaching topic ""work-ups.""  In                     addition to background content, it will contain classroom                       demonstrations which have been tested and are written in a                      form useable for teachers.  A second section will consist of                    brief biographies of physicists including minorities and                        women.  The intent is to provide role models for students.                      The third  section  will be a bibliography of textbooks,                        ""popular physics books"", young adult book and other resource                    books.  Following the Fermilab model it will be a three-ring                    loose leaf manual so it is a ""living"" body of work.  The                        early draft of the manual will be the template for the                          lecture series.  The revised manual will also be a valuable                     resource for Boston area teachers planning a field trip to                      the Bates Laboratory.                                                                                                                                           Project participants will be high school teachers from public                   and private schools in the area served by the North Shore                       Physics Teachers Association, from southern New Hampshire to                    Boston.  The project provides opportunities for three-master                    teachers and 20 additional teachers via the lecture series.                     The master teachers may earn 5 quarter hours graduate credit                    and underprepared teachers 4 quarter hours graduate credit.

The research activity to be supported includes: designing, synthesizing, and  analyzing the reactivities of synthetic analogues of such molecules; synthesizing inorganic,  organic, and organometallic materials whose structures and properties are novel, and analyzing  new photochemical and metal-mediated processes.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",0000099|12,Other Applications NEC|Chemistry,Thomas,J,Katz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tjk1@columbia.edu                                                               ,1995,278795,

Particular emphasis is placed on measurements of electromagnetic and weak properties of the nucleon using electron scattering at Jefferson Laboratory and MIT-Bates. Such data provide precise information about the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization in the nucleon. A major component of our program is the G0 experiment at Jefferson Laboratory, in which parity violation in polarized electron scattering from hydrogen and deuterium is used to identify the contribution of strange quark-antiquark pairs to  the proton's charge and magnetic moment. Coupled to this activity is the determination of ""anapole"" contributions to proton structure, which arise from parity-violating electromagnetic effects. Also proposed are studies of nucleon excitations using polarization measurements of the recoiling nucleon, and the use of kaon electroproduction to create hypernuclei in which one nucleon in a nuclear system is replaced by a lambda particle.

Ethics and Values               Studies, in SSTS, supports research on ethical and value aspects                of the interaction between science, technology and society.  This               research project uses the techniques of historical research to                  study a particular episode of this interaction--the nuclear winter              phenomenon.  Controversy existed from the moment of its                         announcement in the fall of 1983.  Some scientists and policymakers             criticized the initial study as being inexact and its publication               premature.  Others reacted against the way it was ""marketed"" to the             public and was the vehicle for a call for changes in national                   defense policy.  Subsequent research modified the original                      conclusions of cold and darkness, but it is widely believed that                the climatic effect would still bring disaster on a global scale.               Nuclear winter is an excellent example of the way in which many                 branches of science contribute to a discovery; of the way in which              science advances by building on earlier work; of the interaction                between science, institutions supporting science, the media, and                the public; and of the impact of science upon public policy.  In                this project, the investigator will examine the published                       literature and use interviews to craft the story of nuclear                     winter's discovery, evolution, popularization, and scientific and               public controversies.  It will highlight different normative views              of the way science and scientists should appear before the public,              and when it is appropirate to urge action by the government based               on scientific knowledge.

This instrument will fill the dual role of  augmenting an existing  500 MHz instrument, which is running at capacity, and  superseding the older of two  existing 300 MHz instruments (11 years old and increasingly  unreliable). The  instrument would be housed in the university-wide NMR  Laboratory under the  supervision of two experienced NMR spectroscopists, who will  maintain it, train users,  and perform many of the more complex experiments.  Approximately 100 graduate  students, postdocs, and undergraduates will use the  instrument for chemical and  biochemical research annually.    The instrument requested is a Bruker DRX-400 with a UNIX  (Silicon Graphics  Indy) based data system and the capability to perform all of  the major liquids NMR  experiments. These include inverse (HMQC, HMBC) and spin-  lock (ROESY,  HOHAHA) experiments which can currently only be performed on  the 500 and are  much in demand. The lack of a versatile alternative  instrument currently constitutes a  serious bottleneck for this large and diverse NMR user  group. The 400 MHz  instrument is highly suitable for molecules up to the  complexity of small peptides,  which includes most of the samples generated by the major  user group of ten faculty  whose research programs are described herein. The NMR Lab  staff, in consultation  with users, will allocate time on the two high field  instruments in order to ensure high  quality results, optimum efficiency, and equitable access.  In addition to more  throughput and fewer delays in data acquisition, increased  hands-on involvement by  graduate students and postdocs in more complex experiments  will be a positive result  of the new instrument in the NMR Lab--making these  individuals more proficient at  practical NMR spectroscopy. The instrument will also be used  in various graduate and  undergraduate courses, including hands-on use in the junior  level physical chemistry  lab oratory.    Besides producing students versed in using a modern  instrument, the proposed  instrument will aid in recruiting and retaining faculty and  graduate students. NMR is  essential to many areas of chemical and biochemical research  and access to it is a key  component of the research environment for individuals  working in these areas. The  proposed instrument is especially important for adequate  support of young  investigators who have recently joined the faculty or who  will be hired in the near  future.",61|0203000,Life Science Biological|Health,David,G,Vander Velde,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dvandervelde@ukans.edu                                                          ,1995,289005,

Candidate electrocatalyst materials for fuel-cell applications will be synthesized through the spontaneous deposition of monolayer quantities of Pt and other noble metal (Ru, Ir, Os, and Re) nanoparticles.  EC-NMR studies will probe the metal surfaces and poisoning adsorbates.  Carbon monoxide tolerance on Pd/Pt electrodes will also be studied.  Electronic-level information, obtained from EC-NMR, will be correlated with the results of electrochemical measurements in an effort to better understand the mechanisms of CO-poisoning.  Such correlations are expected to help guide the preparation of anodes for methanol electro-oxidation.  Reviewers recognized the PIs as pioneers in the development of EC-NMR for examining changes in the electronic state of the substrate and adsorbate-structure bonding.  A correlation of the surface work function changes as a function of adsorption and overpotential is important in the fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of an electrode process. The broader impacts of this project will be to train graduate and undergraduate students in the methods of electrocatalysis.  This research could help guide the development of improved fuel-cell catalysts for applications in transportation and mobile applications.",0308000,Industrial Technology,Andrzej, ,Wieckowski,Eric, ,Oldfield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,andrzej@scs.uiuc.edu                                                            ,2002,289748,

This research is designed to study the                      utility of combining magic angle spinning (MAS) of dilute spins                 like carbon-13 with the sensitivity of abundant spins like                      protons by spatial localization methods combined with                           high-power cross-polarization and proton decoupling. It is                      further proposed that the use of an appropriate pulse sequence,                 in combination with an rf gradient, should permit rare spin NMR                 spectra of localized regions of a given sample. Thus, the                       overall goal of this research is to obtain chemical information                 from an NMR spectrum  within a selected region of a sample.                     Such an approach should have applications in many areas of                      chemical research including 1) organic solids and polymers, 2)                  reactions at interfaces, 3) isotopically labeled molecules                      doped into porous materials, 4) layered materials, and                          5) devices subject to defects cracks or other imperfections.

In this  proposal, we shall investigate the properties of this hot  dense matter using both effective Lagrangians and models  that are based on the quantum chrodynamics.  In particular,  hadron masses and couplings at finite densities and  temperatures will be studied since they are expected to be  significantly modified in a medium.  Including these medium  effects in the relativistic transport model allows a  realistic description of heavy ion collisions at energies  available from present accelerators.  The study of dilepton  production from these collisions will then provide direct  information on the properties of the hot dense matter due to  the relatively weak interactions of dileptons in matter.  The production of strange particles will also be  investigated as they offer another promising probe of the  hot dense matter as a result of strangeness conservation.  Our long range goal is to extend the relativistic transport  model to include the quark and gluon degrees of freedom so  that one can describe nuclear collisions at future  relativistic heavy ion colliders in which a quark-gluon  plasma is expected to be formed in the initial stage. the  proposed study makes it possible to identify the existence  of the quark-gluon plasma and to study its properties.  ***",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Che Ming, ,Ko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ko@comp.tamu.edu                                                                ,1995,295773,

Ziegler of Boston University will conduct a series of experiments to investigate the electronic and nuclear responses to impressed strong laser fields.  Three tasks will be pursued: 1) ultrafast spectroscopic techniques will be used to investigate the solvation properties of supercritical fluids (SCFs); 2) a novel two-photon absorption technique will be developed; and 3) a new method for the characterization of short optical pulses will be implemented.  The first of these consists of three sub-parts, namely: a) investigations of femtosecond infrared photon echoes of SCF solutions; b) investigations of the optical heterodyne-detected (OHD) rotational Raman responses of hydrogen in SCFs; and c) a study of the polarization specific OHD Raman responses of neat SCFs.  This research will be done in collaboration with theory groups and an experimental physics group.    Students and postdoctoral research associates will participate in this research and will be trained in one of the forefront areas of contemporary physical chemistry in preparation for advance study or employment in academia, industry, or government laboratories.

Neutron scattering experiments at the University's accelerator laboratory are designed to a) explore multiphonon vibrations in spherical and deformed nuclei, b) examine the role of fast electromagnetic transitions in the decay of collective excitations, c) provide data leading to more realistic models of nuclear level densities, d) address the separate roles of neutrons and protons in nuclear excitations, and e) expand our understanding of nuclear shell structure and the nature of nuclear shape transitions.  Recently developed techniques to measure short lifetimes with the Doppler-shift attenuation method and to perform gamma-gamma coincidences following inelastic neutron scattering are crucial in many of these studies.  A new research direction has been initiated to take advantage of the special opportunities provided by the development of the GEANIE array of gamma-ray detectors coupled with the spallation neutron source at the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE).

The concept of a spindle matrix was proposed long ago based on theoretical considerations of the requirements for force production to help organize and stabilize the microtubule spindle during mitosis; however, molecular evidence corroborating its existence has been  elusive.  Dr. Johansen previously characterized a  novel nuclear protein in Drosophila, Skeletor, the distribution of which exhibits many features consistent  with it being part of a spindle matrix.  Skeletor is localized to chromatin during interphase but reorganizes into a true fusiform spindle-structure  during prophase at a time when tubulin is still excluded from the nucleus.  However, Skeletor encodes  a low-complexity protein with  no obvious  motifs,  making  it unlikely that Skeletor itself is a structural component of a spindle matrix but rather that it is a member of a multi-protein complex.  In searching for other members of such a complex, Dr. Johansen recently identified a protein directly interacting with Skeletor that she named Chromator.  Chromator contains a chromodomain and co-localizes  with Skeletor on the chromosomes at interphase as well as to the Skeletor-defined spindle during metaphase.   Reduction of Chromator levels reveals that Chromator is an essential  gene affecting  spindle function and chromosome segregation.   Dr. Johansen  will directly test the hypothesis that Chromator plays a functional role in the cell cycle, by analyzing the effects on cell cycle progression of reduced levels of Chromator using P-element mutations.  She will use EMS-mutagenesis to generate a range of Chromator mutant alleles, including complete nulls, which will allow her to genetically dissect the functional requirements of Chromator in different contexts and  which will help  in  identifying essential residues. The necessary and sufficient domains of Chromator will be identified by expressing mutated  and deleted constructs of Chromator transgenically in null mutant flies.  The hypothesis that Chromator is a member of a multi-protein complex will be further tested by using Chromator as a means to identify other components of the putative spindle matrix by  immunoaffinity  purification and  pull-down assays.  The functional analysis of Chromator and its associated proteins will provide new and important insights into the mechanisms behind the complex and highly choreographed process of chromosome segregation during cell division.    This project will further provide the research basis for undergraduate and high school training on internships and honors projects within the laboratory.  The PI  will continue  her efforts to  motivate elementary and college students to consider research careers by both working directly with such students in the  laboratory as well as by  presenting general research talks at primarily undergraduate institutions and high schools  that introduce students to  the controversies and mysteries still to be explained in cell division.

Thus, as proliferating fibroblasts become quiescent there is a significant decrease in both the rate of macromolecular uptake into the nucleus, and the functional size of the transport channels.  Conversely, nuclear import capacity increases above the proliferating level in rapidly dividing, SV40 transformed cells.  These transport changes could have a significant effect on the regulation of transcriptional and translational events.  Similarly, the modulation of nuclear efflux could play a fundamental role in controlling cell metabolism.  Since substances exit the nucleus through the same transport channels that are used for uptake, and are subject to the same size restrictions, it is reasonable to assume that the import results mentioned above reflect overall transport activity.  However, it is also possible that specific factor which enhance signal-mediated import have no effect on export.  Therefore, considering its regulatory potential, we will investigate macromolecular movement  out of the nucleus in transformed, quiescent, and dividing BALB/c cells.  Relative efflux rates, as well as the size of particles that are able to exit the nucleus will be determined.  This will be determined.  This will be accomplished by injecting RNA- or polynucleotide-coated gold into the nucleoplasm and following its intracellular distribution by electron microscopy.  To facilitate export, the gold preparations will be treated with oocyte nuclear extracts, or specific proteins that are known to be required for nuclear efflux. %%%  This proposal will investigate the mechanisms by which components within the cell are transported across barrier (that is, the nuclear envelope) which separates the genetic material of the cell from the remainder of the cell (that is, the cytoplasm).  The rate at which material is transported is a reflection of the level of metabolic activity of the cell, but the mechanism which controls this is not clear.  A better understanding of this mechanism may allow researchers to cause a slow and quiescent cell to become an active cell. ***                          ;                                                 Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:WWUSERTEMPLATENORMAL.DOT                                       9420795                             toni douglas                        toni douglas                @      ?                            @                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            @      b                                                                                                    @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      3                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                         e =       e                   +                                                           j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       s   1                                                                                                   5               U           T       3   s                       j                                                                         s               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           m                                                                                                 9523410 Feldherr   Recently, we found that signal-mediated nuclear import varies as a function of cellular activity.  Thus, as proliferating fibroblasts become quiescent there is a significant decrease in both the rate of macromolecular uptake into the nucleus, and the functional size of the transport channels.  Conversely, nuclear import capacity increases above the proliferating level in rapidly dividing, SV40 transformed cells.  These transport changes could have a significant effect on the regulation of transcriptional and translational events.

Alternative oxidase is encoded by a small nuclear gene family and appears to link mitochondrial energy balance and biosynthetic carbon metabolism, especially under stress condition.  The goals of this study are to investigate nuclear/mitochondrial communication in plants using synthesis and activation of the alternative oxidase, and to investigate carbon/energy balance function of the alternative pathway respiration employing transgenic plants.  The goal will be approached using genetic, molecular, biochemical and physiological analysis of plants in which the alternative oxidase is altered and in in-vitro assays.",,,Lee, ,McIntosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mcintos1@msu.edu                                                                ,1997,302776,

The ultimate goal of the research outlined in this proposal is          twofold:  to develop and document a methodology for quantifying the             benefits of passive reactor safety features, and to determine the               safety gains in incorporating into a 340-MWe boiling water reactor              (BWR) (a) natural circulation and (b) a passive steam-driven emergency          core cooling system (ECCS) contained within a prestressed concrete              reactor vessel.  The method as applied to the OSU-ISR will include              verification of full power, shutdown and accident natural circulation           modes, identification of system reliability based on natural                    circulation parameters and finally, comparison of results with current          LWR systems.  The proposed research program in essence will develop a           methodology and apply to the OSU-ISR concept to determine the relative          safety and reliability of the modified BWR system as compared to                current light water reactor technology.""

The research projects will have impact on developments in the field of nuclear theory, nuclear astrophysics and the general field of mesoscopic physics. Many of the projects are coupled to the experimental program at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and with those at other laboratories. Projects are also coupled with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA). In a broader context, successful progress in the program is important for our understanding of the basic constituents of matter and nucleosynthesis in the Universe. The studies of many-body properties, chaos and collectivity in nuclear structure, have a strong interdisciplinary aspect since the nucleus is an exemplary case of a self-sustaining finite Fermi-system with strong interactions.  The proposed research is expected to help studies in physics of Bose- and Fermi-condensates, complex molecules, solid state microdevices and quantum computing. The proposal has a considerable educational component being part of the highly ranked nuclear physics program at NSCL/MSU.   The proposed research relates to broad questions in science including: What are the limits of nuclear stability?, How did the chemical evolution of the Universe proceed?, What are the ways of self-organization in interacting many-body systems? and How does order coexist with chaos and complexity in mesoscopic systems? Specific topics include: (i) development of new analytical and computational tools for the description of nuclear structure, especially for the nuclei far from stability; (ii) detailed consideration of specific nuclear phenomena and nuclear processes that shed light on the new features encountered with the experimental advances into virgin territory of unstable nuclei; (iii) calculations and modeling of structural and dynamical aspects of nuclear processes of astrophysical interest; (iv) studies of many-body quantum chaos, its coexistence with collective and regular features in nuclear structure, and properties of the nucleus as a mesoscopic system.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,B.

Work will also be continued on glasses and the glass                transition, emphasizing the effects of quench rate (and therefore               transition temperature) on structure and defects.  Finally, the                 clustering of protonated species in hydrous glasses will be                     studied using multiple quantum 1-H NMR techniques.  The results                 of these studies will improve our understanding of the                          fundamental thermodynamic and transport properties of important                 silicate melts and glasses.",0106000|42,Materials Research|Geological Sciences,Jonathan,F,Stebbins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,stebbins@stanford.edu                                                           ,1987,309019,

However the  manifestations of this interaction in nuclear matter (hadrons) is only understood in the narrowest of settings.  Quark confinement and the  structure of hadrons remain intriguing puzzles.  Our proposal will study these questions in two broad programs: 1) We have identified a few new states that do not fit into the simple pictures of hadron structure.  Other states of this type will be identified and their decay properties will be measured. 2) Electron induced reactions will be used to study the proton and other baryons.  Hard-scattering experiments will reveal the quark structure of these states.

This equipment will enhance   research in a number of areas including the following:  (1)  human   erythrocytes, disulfide bonds in peptides and the interaction of peptides   with heparin (2)  structural studies of vitamin D in vitamin D-protein   complexes (3)  determination of non-standard nucleic acid structures (4)    investigation of the roles played by low-barrier hydrogen bonds in enzyme   catalysis, and (5)  structure-function relationships for macromolecular   structures of biological significance.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.    It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas   such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.

In particular, the investigator will explore new models for the KK-groups of Kasparov.  On the analytical side he would focus on local approximation properties such as quasidiagonality and its refinements. The basic idea beyond the classification program is that that the simplicity and other nonstable K-theory conditions for a nuclear C*-algebra translate to certain internal dynamical properties of the algebra. In their turn,  these properties lead to surprising rigidity phenomena where an algebra is completely determined by its homotopy type or even by its K-theory groups.  C*-algebras can be thought as  collections of infinite matrices of numbers displaying a rich algebraic and topological structure.  The C*-algebra theory is the standard framework for quantum mechanics.  It offers  functional analytic ways of expressing and analysing fundamental noncommutative aspects of the symmetries of the physical world.  The proposed research will attempt to uncover and explain rigidity properties of nuclear  C*-algebras.  This theory has deep ramifications in dynamical systems and geometric theory of groups.

Emphasis is on the study of hadronic and weak                    interactions in few-nucleon systems and in light nuclei, using                  reactions initiated by intense beams of polarized ions.  Examples               of experiments under investigation include:  beta-decay asymmetry               measurements on polarized nuclei produced with these beams, to                  distinguish Gamov-Teller from Fermi contributions; triton and                   helion bound state wave function determinations, to test                        calculations of nuclear three-body bound states; and several                    experiments addressing parity and charge-symmetry nonconservation               in nucleon-nucleon and in light nuclear systems.  The work is                   being carried out at the University of Wisconsin EN tandem                      accelerator laboratory, the Indiana University Cyclotron                        Facility, and at the SIN injector cyclotron in Zurich.                               These experiments explore, in a precise and highly sensitive               manner, the interface between the fundamental interactions of                   physics and the properties of nuclei, nuclear reactions, and                    nuclear transitions.",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Lynn,D,Knutson,Paul, ,Quin,Willy          , ,Haeberli,,,,,,,,,,,,,knutson@physics.wisc.edu                                                        ,1987,319247,

The overall goal of the NNPSS is to  provide students with a reference frame for defining critical problems  of nuclear physics and the most useful methods of analysis of the  problems.  The intent is to broaden the students' appreciation for and  interest in the field of nuclear physics, while also strengthening them  technically.  In bringing students togther from different parts of  nuclear physics, the NNPSS also plays an important role in building a  nuclear-physics community, i.e. the school often is the first  opportunity for young researchers to interact across subfields and to  network with their peers.  The NNPSS is organized and hosted each year by leading nuclear  physicists at major universities and national laboratories.  The site  of the NNPSS is moved each year so that on average participating  students travel similar distances over the lifetime of the schools.   The NNPSS is governed by a national steering committee, appointed by  the Executive Committee of the Division of Nuclear Physics of the  American Physical Society.  The Principal Investigators work with the  steering committee and with the organizers to facilitate the annual  schools.

These effective theories allow for a description of hadronic and nuclear systems preserving a rigorous connection with the fundamental theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). One of these studies will address the phenomenology of excited baryons by means of a theoretical framework known as the 1/N expansion of QCD, where N is the number of color degrees of freedom. This plan is of relevance to the current experimental programs on excited baryons at Jefferson Lab and elsewhere. Theoretical studies of some fundamental aspects of the 1/N expansion will also be carried out, especially with focus on the phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry in QCD. Another study will address the problem of describing QCD at low and intermediate energies with effective theories. In particular, the project will consider the problem of extending the range of validity of the low energy effective theory of QCD known as Chiral Perturbation Theory to the intermediate energy domain through the inclusion of excited meson states in the effective theory. The application of effective theories to nuclear physics will focus on the study of the low energy expansion of nuclear current matrix elements, in particular electromagnetic currents, for which a large number of phenomenological applications are possible. The project has also an important education component, which includes the training of a PhD student and collaborations with postdoctoral associates.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Jose,L,Goity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,goity@jlab.org                                                                  ,2009,331275,

This grant provides funds for the operation of IUCF, for support of its  user program, for the research of the Indiana University staff, and for the training of  graduate students in nuclear science, accelerator physics, and related fields.  The  facilities at IUCF include a 200 MeV cyclotron and a 500 MeV booster synchrotron with  electron beam cooling.  Experiments are possible with the extracted cyclotron beam in  several experimental areas, and using ultra-thin internal targets in the Cooler ring.   Polarized beams are available in all areas, and polarized gas targets can be used in  the Cooler ring.  A new high-intensity polarized ion source (HIPIOS) will provide a  twenty-fold increase in beam currents. A wide variety of detectors can be used,  including magnetic spectrometers, neutron time-of-flight systems, recoil detector, and  large scintillator and wire chamber arrays.  The K600 spectrometer with focal plane  polarimeter and Beam Swinger neutron detection system will be used in a broad range  of spin transfer reactions aimed at studying effective nucleon-nucleon interactions.   Studies will be carried out in threshold meson production, few-body reactions,  nucleon-nucleon scattering, nucleon-nucleus reactions, all directed towards improved  understanding of the hadronic substructure of nuclei, the underlying role of meson  degrees of freedom, and tests of fundamental symmetries.

Knowledge of the properties of nuclear matter under such extreme conditions is not only interesting in itself but also useful in our understanding of astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosions, neutron star properties, nuclear synthesis, and the evolution of early universe.  In this proposal, various theoretical models will be used to study the properties of such a matter. Also, we shall continue to develop a relativistic transport model to describe the space-time evolution of heavy ion collision dynamics by including the predicted properties of hot dense matter, the different behavior between protons and neutrons, and the quark-gluon substructure of the nucleon. The transport model will be useful for studying heavy ion collisions at both existing accelerators and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider being constructed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as the Radioactive Beam Facility that is being proposed. Comparing the theoretical predictions with the experimental observations will allow us to extract information on nuclear matter properties that have not been known before.

Research topics include high-energy electron scattering, ultra-cold neutron research, and ultra-high energy cosmic ray studies. Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students is integrated throughout the program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in these frontier areas of nuclear physics and astrophysics . The goals of our research in high-energy electron scattering are twofold:  a.) study of the internal structure of the protons and neutrons that are the basic constituents of the atomic nucleus, and b.) high-precision testing of the basic theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions to reveal potential new physics. We will perform theoretical work related to the interpretation of the results of  these experiments. We will also embark on a new experimental program utilizing novel techniques to produce and study ultra-cold neutrons. These neutrons are converted to very cold temperatures where they can be trapped for long periods of time, enabling very precise measurements of their properties. The first experiment will study the violation of mirror symmetry in the decay of ultra-cold neutrons. We will also perform research and development towards a new measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. The goal of the new electric dipole moment experiment is to improve the precision by a factor of 100 compared to previous measurements; observation of the electric dipole moment signals violation of time reversal, and would provide important information related to the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe and the new physical phenomena responsible. Theoretical studies related to these experimental efforts are also part of this program. We will continue our deployment and operation of the first phase of the California HIgh school Cosmic ray ObServatory (CHICOS). The goals of this innovative program are a.) establish an important scientific facility for ultra-high energy cosmic ray research by utilizing the Los Angeles area school system infrastructure, b.) provide LA high school science teachers and students with an exciting opportunity to participate in a frontier scientific research project. During this grant period we plan to complete the deployment of ~90 sites to form the largest operating ground array in the northern hemisphere and begin to collect a sample of ultra-high energy air shower events. Operation of this array during this period will yield results capable of shedding light on the origin of these remarkable events and will demonstrate a new cost-effective approach to constructing and operating very large ground arrays. In addition, the impact of the CHICOS program in providing opportunities in research for the high school teacher and student population of Los Angeles is potentially enormous ",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Robert,D,McKeown,Steven,E,Koonin,Bradley        ,W,Filippone,,,,,,,,,,,,,bmck@caltech.edu                                                                ,2003,341273,

The program is                    based on two classes of nuclear reactions: elastic scattering                   and knockout reactions.  Recent measurements of Lithium elastic                 scattering data at 210 MeV on a range of targets have provided                  the first unique Lithium-nucleus optical model potentials,                      together with preliminary energy and target-mass dependence.                    Higher energy measurements are proposed to obtain further                       confirmation of the unique potentials, and their energy and                     target-mass dependence.  Proton and alpha induced alpha-                        knockout reactions heavier targets, will permit a systematic                    study of alpha clustering in nuclei across the periodic table.                  The search for heavier clusters by means of knockout reactions                  to complement results of transfer reactions will provide data,                  for theorists to develop improved cluster structure                             calculations.",0000099|13,Other Applications NEC|Physics,Aruna, ,Nadasen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nadasen@umd.umich.edu                                                           ,1989,343492,

The common denominator of these systems is that they all obey the Bose-Einstein statistics and can be simulated numerically using very efficient, newly developed algorithms by this investigator. The importance of these studies is that they can tell us how matter behaves under very extreme circumstances.  In the case of pions, which are created in ultra high energy collisions of large nuclei, such as gold or uranium, their collective excitations reveal ways in which a basic symmetry of nature is restored at high tempearature. Such a high temperature occurs nowhere else naturally except during the early Big-Bang formation of the universe. In Bose-Einstein condensations, a single quantum state is occupied by a macroscopic number of particles. Thus the very fine details of a quantum state can be magnified a million-billion-billion times. The exploitation of this occupation can in principle be used to make exceedingly high precision measurments.

The subjects include Los Alamos weapons scientists of the second generation (that is, those who came to the laboratory during the post-war build-up of 1947-54), their spouses, laboratory administrators and non-scientific workers, community leaders, and those who provided professional services or goods to the community. Many of these latter were Hispanics or Native Americans who lived in surrounding communities and commuted to work in Los Alamos. The interviews will be recorded on audiotape by the primary investigator using a largely open-ended format. The basic question underlying the interviews will be: ""How did the laboratory and its mission shape your work, community and family life?""  The purpose of these interviews is to provide primary source material for a book on the history of the laboratory and the community of Los Alamos during the early years of the Cold War. An in-depth community study, the project is nevertheless intended to address questions that go beyond the particularity of the Los Alamos experience in order to contribute to historical understanding of the arms race and the impact of weapons science, militarization and security culture on Cold War America.

The                     processes involved in maturations of proteins into                              chloroplasts have been characterized.

These studies examine both the dynamics of                  the nuclear reactions and the degrees of freedom required to                    describe the structure of the nuclear states.  The major emphasis               of the program will involve studies of electromagnetic processes.               In particular with the expected completion of CEBAF accelerator                 in 1994, much of the effort will be directed toward the                         experiments associated with the CEBAF.

The proposed                           experiments, at CEBAF as well as NIKHEF and MIT-Bates, address                  physics questions ranging from the determination of nuclear                     structure functions to nucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei to                the underlying quark structure of baryon resonances.

In eukaryotic cells the genome is separated from the rest of the cell by the nuclear envelope. In animal cells the nuclear envelope is degraded at mitosis and then reformed around each of the two sets of chromosomes.  This orderly breakdown and re-assembly of the nuclear envelope at every mitosis depends on the nuclear lamins, which form a meshwork of intermediate filaments that is anchored to the inner nuclear envelope by means of integral membrane proteins.  In contrast, the yeast nuclear envelope remains intact throughout the cell cycle.  As the intra-nuclear mitotic spindle elongates, the nucleus of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, changes from round to oblong to dumbbell-shaped before separating into two individual nuclei, each of which contains a full complement of chromosomes. It is not known how the shape or structure of the yeast nucleus is maintained or how nuclear division is accomplished. In the fully sequenced genomes of budding or fission yeast, there are no genes that encode lamin-like proteins.  The goal of this project is to identify and characterize the proteins that are required for nuclear structure and function in the fission yeast, S. pombe.  This will be accomplished using two complementary strategies: genetic screens to identify proteins that are required for proper nuclear division and a genomic/proteomic approach in which candidate proteins that localize to the nuclear envelope and are required for nuclear division will be characterized. These studies will answer long-standing questions regarding the structural organization of yeast nuclei and differences between cells that break down their nuclear envelope at mitosis and those that do not.  This work will have more general applications for understanding how membranes change shape and topology. In these respects, nuclear division in yeast has similarities to vesicle budding from membrane-bound organelles and to the process by which many types of cells and organelles divide. The project will provide research training at three levels: undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral.

The general objectives are the study of the structure of the nucleon (neutron or proton) and the nature of the nuclear force.  This group is involved in experiments being performed, or to be performed at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jlab) in Virginia and at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island, New York.  An experiment is in progress at Jlab to determine the charge distribution inside the neutron.  The neutron, while neutral overall, is known to consist of objects with both positive and negative charges.  These objects are called ""quarks"".  The quarks are held together by the exchange of particles called ""gluons"".  Exactly how the quarks combine, move, and interact inside the neutron is not known.  A precise measurement of the charge distribution, called the Electric Form Factor, will provide one of the most sensitive tests available of various models of the neutron structure.  These measurements are only recently possible and require the electron beam characteristics now available at Jlab and involve the use of a large-volume neutron polarimeter developed by this group in experiments performed during the last decade at other accelerator facilities.  The development, installation, calibration, and operation of the polarimeter represents the unique contribution of this group to this important experiment.  This group plans also to perform another experiment at Jlab to study short-range correlation between nucleons inside nuclei.  Such short-range correlations are known to exist, but the exact nature and strength of such correlations are only poorly determined.  This group will bring its expertise with neutron detectors to help study such correlations involving neutrons.  This group has recently joined an effort planned to study interactions between colliding beams of polarized protons using the ""STAR"" detector at RHIC (STAR stands for Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC).  The object of this study is to determine the exact origin of the intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, of the proton.  The spin, like the charge distribution, arises from the existence, interactions and movements of the constituents of the proton, generally believed to be the quarks and gluons.  To date, only the contributions from the quarks has been determined;  this project offers the possibility of determining the contribution to the spin of the proton due to gluons.  In order to measure these contributions, it is necessary to observe hadronic jets produced at relatively small angles in the collisions.  This group, together with a collaboration of other researchers from Indiana University, Argonne National Laboratory, and others, will construct a new ""end-cap calorimeter"" to be installed at one end of the present STAR detector at RHIC.  It will be this group's responsibility to provide characterizations and calibrations of the multi-anode photomultiplier tubes used for particle detection in this new calorimeter.

However the 5' flanking regions of U6 genes from a                   variety of organisms contain transcription control elements                     that appear to be very similar to those employed on pol II-                     transcribed U1 and U2 genes.  Moreover, unlike typical pol                      III genes, no internal control elements have been found in                      the U6 snRNA gene.  In one project a detailed analysis will                     be made of the transcription control elements in the proximal                   region of a human U6 gene.  Experiments are proposed that use                   in vitro transcription and experession in vivo from                             transfected genes to investigate the promoter element(s) that                   cause the U6 gene to be transcribed by RNA polymerase III.                      The U6 ""basal"" promoter situated in the 5' proximal region                      appears to be rigidly constrained with respect to the                           relative spacing and/or orientation of control elements.  The                   role of spacing will be studied in detail through the                           construction of a series of deletion and insertion mutants in                   the U6 gene promoter.  The mechanism of U6 transcription will                   also be studied by partial purification of trans-acting                         factors.  A S100 extract that supports accurate U6                              transcription will fractionated through several                                 chromatographic steps.

It is also possible for the gluons to form particles, called glueballs, without quark constituents.  The discovery and study of glueballs is one of the most important areas of nuclear/particle physics. Using QCD, we are investigating possible states of mesons and glueballs with emphasis on identifying experiments to test our theoretical picture.  Of particular importance is our recent prediction of a low-mass glueball which we feel is strongly coupled to a two-pion resonance, called the Sigma.  We are investigating decay rates of particles which will provide tests of this theory of the glueball/sigma.  It is possible to carry out some of these experimental tests at Jefferson Laboratory. 	We are also carrying out investigations of the Pomeron, whose exchange has long been known to dominate high energy elastic and diffractive processes.  It is almost certain that the Pomeron is composed largely of glue, and recently our group has given strong evidence that the Pomeron is closely related to glueballs, including our proposed glueball/sigma.  We shall calculate cross sections for sigma production to test the nature of the Pomeron.  Experiments could be carried out at the 50 GeV accelerators proposed at Los Alamos Laboratory and in Japan.  The proton-proton collider, using the RHIC facility at Brookhaven Laboratory, would be excellent for experimental measurements of the cross sections. 	Properties of hadrons at finite densities and temperatures are also being investigated.  We have completed a preliminary study for hadronic matter at temperatures below the chiral phase transition, which occurs at the temperature of the universe about a millionth of a second after the so-called big bang.  We shall study the effect of instantons, certain gluonic modes, on the properties of matter both below and above this phase transition, and propose tests at the RHIC accelarator.  We shall also investigate possible evidence for this early-universe phase transition in observational studies of the cosmic microwave background.  These interdisciplinary investigations of relationships between nuclear/particle physics and cosmology use field theoretic methods developed in studies of condensed matter physics.

Research at the NSL is based on a broad program in low energy  nuclear physics and includes studies of nuclear reactions, structure,  dynamics, and fundamental symmetries spanning the subfields of Nuclear  Astrophysics, Weak Interactions and Fundamental Symmetries, Nuclear  Structure, and studies of Nuclear Reactions with Radioactive Ion Beams  (RIBs). This proposal represents a growing trend towards a more cohesive  and synergistic research program as our interests coalesce in the area of  Nuclear Astrophysics. We are enthusiastic about future developments in low  energy physics with the proposed construction of the rare isotope  accelerator RIA. Our funding request includes the support of three  accelerators (JN, KN, and FN) and various new developments in detectors,  ion sources, and new systems for fast transport of radioactive materials.  While the scientific output of the NSL and its impact to low-energy nuclear  physics has been tremendous, the most important part of our mission is  education. The obvious impact to Technology transfer via our education  mission has been substantial. Typically, 9 Ph.D. are awarded in a given  three year period.

Most cellular events are controlled by precise regulation of protein expression.  Termination of protein expression is commonly achieved by moving proteins into cellular recycling centers, where they are broken down into amino acids that can be reutilized in new protein synthesis.  Entry into these recycling centers is tightly regulated. Proteins that are turned-over inside proteasomes, barrel-shaped recycling centers in the cytoplasm, need a special modification that serves as a key or signal for entry.  This ""key"" is a small sequence of amino acids, named ubiquitin, which is linked or ligated to proteins by a class of regulatory proteins known as ubiquitin ligases.  Ubiquitin ligases thus control protein expression by their ability to recognize and tag other proteins for destruction.  Ubiquitin ligases have multiple substrates and thus commonly impact multiple key cellular pathways, including regulation of the cell cycle, programmed cell death, and the integration of signaling pathways during development. Uncovering the function of ubiquitin ligases is essential to our understanding of all cellular processes.  Most ubiquitin ligases are soluble proteins that ubiquitinate cytoplasmic proteins.  This research will focus on identifying the proteins tagged for turnover by a specific ubiquitin ligase, an endosomal membrane protein that is stabilized and moves to the inner nuclear membrane when cell signaling pathways under the outer cell membrane are activated. To identify proteins tagged by this ligase, experiments will compare the protein composition of purified inner nuclear membrane when the ligase is active and when its expression is knocked down.  Proteins that escape ubiquitin-mediated degradation and thus increase in quantity in the inner nuclear membrane fraction when expression of the ligase is knocked down will be identified by mass spectrometry.  Identification of ligase substrates correlated with specific nuclear functions will indicate a role for the endosomal ubiquitin ligase in nuclear regulation.  Broader impacts:  These studies will serve as a vehicle for educating undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, including members of under-represented groups.  The project is based on observations initially obtained by a graduate student.  The studies were confirmed and expanded by a postdoctoral fellow.  The principal investigator has and will continue to train undergraduate chemistry and biology majors, who either elect research for course credit or spend the summer in the lab with REU grant support.  The undergraduates attend lab meetings, have their own projects, and are included on publications. All trainees not only master new techniques but, more importantly, learn to analyze data, to propose creative solutions to problems, and to summarize and present data in a professional format. Mentoring undergraduates is excellent training for the graduate students and postdocs in the lab, teaching them to teach, to organize and schedule, and to encourage others.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Ann,H,Erickson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ann_erickson@med.unc.edu                                                        ,2009,367942,

In the first year, we will be completing data analysis from the G0 experiment in which parity-violating electron scattering is used to determine the contributions of strange quarks to the proton's charge and magnetism. Later in the grant period we will participate in an experiment that uses muon pair production to probe the distribution of antiquarks in the proton (FNAL experiment E906). This latter measurement addresses a number of unanswered questions about the nonperturbative QCD structure of the proton, such as the degree of charge symmetry in proton's internal structure and the role of antiquarks in ground state properties of free and bound nucleons. Our group is also participating in experiments that use precision measurements of neutron beta decay to test fundamental symmetries. The broader impact of this group's research is primarily through providing outstanding research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.

Our proposed research uses particle accelerators to study nuclear reactions and nuclear structure at very small distances.  In most cases we use electron beams from the accelerator at Jefferson Laboratory. 	Our experimental program is largely focussed on studies of the quark structure of nucleons and the dynamics of nucleons and mesons embedded in nuclear systems.  We use measurements of the spin direction of particles involved in nuclear reactions to enhance the precision and selectivity of our studies.  We are studying both electromagnetic and weak interaction properties of the nucleon.  We also propose studies of the production of strange mesons and the formation of nuclei with embedded strange mesons. 	In addition to the experiments proposed, we are heavily involved in the support and construction of detector systems for detectors and liquefied gas targets for the Jefferson Laboratory Experimental Halls.

The excellent charged-particle detector resolution recently attained in resonant particle decay spectroscopy will allow levels in lieht nuclei to be studied within a few hundred keV of their a emission threshold.  The largely unexplored rank 3 analyzing powers can now be studied using the 7Li beam from the laser-pumped polarized ion source.  In addition, the high beam currents and polarizations from this source will permit detailed investigation of the origin of the tensor force in 6Li scattering.  Present and future laser capabilities along with beams from the tandem/LINAC will allow precise tests of quantum electrodynamics calculations of energy levels of low to intermediate Z helium-like ions.  The Hall B experime ntal physics program at CEBAF is set to commence and the capabilities of the CLAS will be aimed at examination of nucleon resonances and strangeness production.  Construction of the Ring-Imaging Cherenkov system for PHENIX is well under way.

The excellent charged-particle detector resolution recently attained in resonant particle decay spectroscopy will allow levels in light nuclei to be studied within a few hundred keV of their a emission threshold.  The largely unexplored rank 3 analyzing powers can now be studied using the 7Li beam from the laser-pumped polarized ion source.  In addition, the high beam currents and polarizations from this source will permit detailed investigation of the origin of the tensor force in 6Li scattering.  Present and future laser capabilities along with beams from the tandem/LINAC will allow precise tests of quantum electrodynamics calculations of energy levels of low to intermediate Z helium-",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Kirby,W,Kemper,Samuel,L,Tabor,Lawrence       ,C,Dennis,Paul           ,D,Cottle,Neil           ,R,Fletcher,,,,,,,nsfaward@res.fsu.edu                                                            ,1995,378153,

Ultrahigh resolution synchrotron-based measurements of X-ray absorption near the 14.4keV  57-Fe Moessbauer resonance reveal the complete vibrational spectrum of Fe.. NRVS provides quantitative information on vibrational amplitudes as well as frequencies and allows one to deduce the direction of Fe motion from measurements on oriented samples. Observations will include structurally sensitive modes, or vibrational spectators, that are not easily measurable using other techniques.  A theme of particular interest is the identification and characterization of vibrational participants, modes directly involved in biological reactions. Fe is the reactive center of many biological reactions, and reactive modes involving the Fe must contribute to the NRVS signal. Measurements on Fe porphyrin powders and single crystals, coupled with normal mode analysis, will establish the character of observed modes, including participants, and provide a basis for interpreting measurements on proteins.  An issue of particular interest in the protein studies is whether vibrations remain localized at the active site, or acquire a more global character by vibrational mixing with the surrounding polypeptide, and the structural factors responsible for this local or global character.    The project will have a broad impact in at least three areas: (1) Work on this project is an outstanding training opportunity.  (2) The project establishes collaborative ties between disciplines and institutions, necessitating diverse expertise in synthetic chemistry, molecular biology, and modern computational approaches. (3) Development and dissemination of next-generation instrumentation at a multi-user facility is an integral aspect of the proposed work, as Instrumental advances developed in support of the proposed work become available to other synchrotron users.

Despite the                       fundamental importance of RNA processing reactions,most are                     not well-understood biochemically.  In particular, little is                    known about these processes in  the nuclei and organelles of                    higher plants.  Here this focus is on the key reactions of                      transfer RNA processing; formation of mature 5' termini by                      the endonuclease ribonuclease P, and formation of mature                        3'termini by as yet uncharacterized endonuclease(s).

These two form factors are directly connected to the charge and current distributions in the nucleon; they are of fundamental importance to both nuclear and particle physics. The extension of the measurement of this important ratio to large four-momentum transfers will be possible using the recoil technique as in 1998. This experiment will provide the bench mark data necessary to test future theoretical descriptions of the structure of the nucleon. The precise knowledge of charge and current distributions in the nucleon is a prerequisite for the test of any theory of the strong interaction based on QCD. Participation in several other experiments in Hall A at JLab will includestudy of polarization transfer in the photodisintegration of the deuteron and in photoduction on the proton. Likewise, polarization transfer in the transition from the proton to the delta resonance will be studied in 2000, making use of the same focal plane polarimeter developed for the program outlined above.  Recent progress in the characterization of the elastic backward pd scattering reaction, based on polarization observables, has brought us close to a model independent determination of the fundamental amplitudes which describe this reaction.

The properties of                   mesons in matter will be studied using density dependent                        masses and coupling constants.  The relativistic transport                      theory will also be generalized to include the density                          dependence of other hadrons.  The long range goal of this work                  is to understand the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion                         collisions such as will be produced in the future RHIC                          facility in search of the quark-gluon plasma.,13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Che Ming, ,Ko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ko@comp.tamu.edu                                                                ,1992,391264,

Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability using low-energy nuclear reactions with short-lived beams such as 6He, 8Li, 7Be, 8B, etc.. These studies are a continuation of a very successful program to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier.  Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity of the continuum is one of the characteristic, defining features of weakly-bound systems.  The work will be carried out primarily with the TwinSol facility at the University of Notre Dame (UND), although the RNB facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and (possibly) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory may also be utilized for specific experiments.  We also propose to make use of the nearly unique capabilities of the beams and experimental equipment available at UND to very accurately measure the (3He,n) reaction on Ge isotopes.  The data obtained from this experiment, when combined with the results from other experiments already underway at Yale University, will enable a much-improved value for the nuclear matrix element relevant for neutrinoless double  decay of 76Ge.  This in turn will allow for a more accurate determination of the mass of the neutrino.  The broader impact of the proposal on graduate, undergraduate, and high school education, as well as the development of a technologically literate workforce, is as follows.  The proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan (UM) and the University of Notre Dame, together with faculty members and students from several other (primarily undergraduate) schools located in close proximity to UM and UND.  The ""hands-on"" training of these students in the use of advanced, state-of-the-art computational methods, nuclear accelerators, radiation detectors, vacuum and cryogenic techniques, and superconducting ion-optical magnetic systems has already had an important impact on the development of a technologically-literate workforce.  Finally, we will continue and expand a highly successful program that involves high-school students from the socio-economically-challenged New Buffalo, MI school district in physics-related research. This program has three components: the development of a nuclear-physics curriculum at NBHS that satisfies State of Michigan standards in this area, a yearly tour of the Notre Dame nuclear physics laboratory by all the physical-sciences students at NBHS, and a one-week residential ""nuclear physics summer camp"" for selected (and highly-motivated) NBHS students interested in learning about careers in physics. The summer program is arranged so that the students can interact directly with physics graduate and undergraduate students, and faculty from several nearby colleges and universities who can share their knowledge and experiences of physics as a career.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)               spectroscopy plays a central role in that process.  NMR is                      introduced and used in the laboratory by students in their first                organic chemistry course, NMR occupies a more advanced level in                 the instrumental analysis course and again at a still more                      advanced level in physical chemistry and undergraduate research.                This Fourier transform NMR is used for analysis of tiny                         quantities of material produced in the beginning microscale                     organic laboratory as well as the structure analysis of newly                   synthesized molecules utilizing 2D techniques.  This modern,                    fast, sensitive NMR has expanded significantly the scope and                    sophistication of a large part of the Mount Holyoke College                     laboratory curriculum.

The  scattering of deuterons from 3He will investigate possible  violation of time-reversal invariance in the strong  interaction.  Other experiments will explore the effects of  three-body forces.

The group will carry out measurements at                 the frontiers of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and                     fundamental symmetries and interactions.  The experiments will                  extend the search for time reversal invariance in nuclear                       systems, for meson exchange currents in beta decay, and for                     axion-like particles in electron-positron interactions. Other                   experiments will use specially developed equipment to study the                 properties of nuclei far from stability.  A series of                           measurements using the Princeton QDDD magnetic spectrometer will                provide new data concerning astrophysical processes that occurred               in the early moments of the universe.                                                A related program of accelerator improvement and of advanced               instrumentation development will continue.  The accelerator                     improvements are aimed at increasing both performance and                       reliability.  The instrumentation research and development will                 include work on bolometer radiation detectors.

These scattering experiments will be performed in  collaboration with scientists at IUCF and elsewhere.  Experiments include pion production near threshold in  few-nucleon systems, and studies of spin dependence  using polarized beams and targets.  The pion is known  to mediate the strong force between nucleons, and this  force shows an interesting dependence on spin degrees  of freedom.  The data provided by these experiments, in  conjunction with theoretical models for interpretation,  will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the  strong interaction which forms nuclei.  ***",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Paul,V,Pancella,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pancella@wmich.edu                                                              ,1994,411830,

In addition to learning the                       content teachers will prepare materials for use in the                          schools.  Emphasis will be placed upon development of                           interdisciplinary school materials.  Funds provide for follow                   up activities which include a three day workshop in the                         spring following the summer program.  Successful curriculum                     materials will be presented and discussed by the workshop                       participants.  A curriculum guide based upon these                              discussions will be disseminated to all participants.

These experiments, involve colliding nuclei and/or nucleons (protons and neutrons). They test basic properties of matter, through the investigation of how the elementary particles, quarks and gluons, which moved freely at the earliest stages of the expanding universe, became bound ('confined') to make up neutrons and protons (nucleons). Nucleons in turn constitute the nuclei of all atoms. Also, by polarizing (aligning the spin of) nucleons that are collided, experiments shed light on their internal structure in novel ways. QCD is generally accepted as the controlling theory for the formation of nucleons and nuclei, but the mechanisms by which it acts to confine quarks and produce new particles in collisions are not fully understood, and is one of the most important challenges in theoretical physics. The proposed research will help to synthesize and extend existing theoretical methods from elementary particle and nuclear physics in this area during a period in which experiments are being performed and analyzed. Progress resulting from this project may also have impact on several related theoretical areas.   This project will provide an ideal opportunity for broadening contact between the nuclear and high energy communities, and between theory and experiment. It is characterized by integrated research and training, and will provide career-enhancing opportunities for the junior participants. The professional environment of this work will emphasize intra- and inter-field communication.

Phytochrome stimulates the activity of              nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) in purified pea nuclei, and                  calcium ions are necessary for this response.  A calmodulin-                    dependent 47 kD NTPase has been isolated from pea nuclei and shown              to have properties that implicate it as being the nuclear NTPase                that is regulated by phytochrome.  This NTPase appears to be                    closely related to a lamin-derived 46 kD NTPase in mammalian                    nuclei, whose activity is thought to be important for RNA export                from nuclei.  Additional sequence information on the plant NTPase               will be obtained to confirm or disprove this relationship.  There               is some evidence that the phosphorylation of lamins in animal                   nuclei plays a critical role in its controlled degradation by                   proteolysis.  The phosphorylation of the pea NTPase will be                     characterized, and its role both in the regulation of NTPase                    activity and in the production of NTPase from lamin-like precursors             will be examined.  The results should contribute to an improved                 understanding of how light can influence nuclear metabolism, with               possible implications also for models of how light regulates plant              gene expression.//",0201000|61,Agriculture|Life Science Biological,Stanley,J,Roux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sroux@uts.cc.utexas.edu                                                         ,1991,422029,

This process may allow higher organisms to have a structurally highly complex nuclear interior during interphase, but not have such structures interfere with the condensation and partitioning of chromosomes during cell division. Such nuclear dynamics require the regulated reversibility of interactions between chromatin and proteins of the nuclear envelope and probably involve dynamic changes of nucleoskeletal structures. Since plants and animals are most likely derived from different unicellular ancestors that underwent intranuclear mitosis, one expects that nuclear assembly and disassembly have evolved twice. Presently, their molecular mechanisms are poorly understood in any system.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand the mechanism, the function in interphase, and the dynamics during cell cycle of chromatin-nuclear envelope interactions in plants. Two novel, interacting plant proteins (MFP 1 and MAF 1) have been identified that are associated both with a filamentous nuclear framework called the nuclear matrix and with the nuclear envelope. MFP 1 is a plant-specific, filament-like protein, which binds specifically to matrix attachment regions (MARs), specific DNA segments which have been proposed to be involved in chromatin organization. In vitro, its MAR-binding activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The hypothesis is that MFP1 is involved in attaching chromatin to the plant interphase nuclear envelope and that MAF 1 is involved in this process through interaction with MFP 1.  The specific questions asked in this project are:  1) How does the localization of MFP 1 and MAF 1 change during cell cycle? The strategy employs dual-color imaging of co-expressed MFP 1 and MAF 1 fusion proteins with GFP spectral variants in synchronized cell cultures. The results will show whether the localization of the two proteins functionally correlates with nuclear envelope dynamics.  2) How does the depletion of MFP 1 and MAF 1 alter nuclear, cell, and plant phenotypes? To this end, insertional knock-out mutations of MFP 1 and MAF 1 will be identified in Arabidopsis. They are expected to cause informative cellular and possibly developmental phenotypes, which will allow conclusions about the in vivo function of the proteins.  3) Is phosphorylation of MFP1 involved in reversible regulation of DNA-binding during cell cycle? The pattern of phosphorylated MFP1 isoforms and their MAR-binding activity will be compared at different cell-cycle stages. The effect of overexpressing a constitutively DNA-binding MFP 1 isoform on cellular and plant phenotypes will be investigated. These data will indicate whether reversible MFP1 phosphorylation is a means to regulate the interaction of chromatin with the nuclear envelope.  Together, the answers to these questions will allow the evaluation of the role of MFP 1 and MAF 1 in chromatin-nuclear envelope interactions in plants. Because of the possibility that nuclear dissociation and re-association have evolved twice in plants and animals, any molecular information about the plant nucleus is likely to add novel concepts to our understanding of a process which is currently enigmatic in any organism. In addition, the discovery of plant-specific aspects of cellular organization could lead to the development of new classes of broad-spectrum herbicides.

Particular emphasis is given to work that would elucidate the character of CP violation. This is an outstanding problem encompassing key issues in particle physics and astrophysics.  In the quark sector, the research includes contributions to the CLEO-c experimental program.  One approach is  through the measurement of the Ks pi+ pi- final state for CP eigenstate mixtures of neutral D mesons. The other is a measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the charm quark, through the M2/E1 amplitude ratio in chi (cj) -> gamma J/psi decay.  In the neutrino sector, the research effort focuses on the Daya Bay Neutrino Oscillation experiment, in which the group is contributing to the muon veto shield and to detailed simulation studies.

One of the most abundant of these membrane networks is the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.  Within this network is a specialized region of sheet membrane, called the nuclear envelope, which physically sequesters the chromosomes from the cytoplasm.   	In order for cells to divide, the chromosomes are duplicated and then during mitosis are pulled apart by the microtubule fibers of the mitotic spindle so that each daughter cell receives a full complement of genetic information.  In animal cells the nuclear envelope breaks down at mitosis, allowing the cytoplasmic spindle to contact and then pull the chromosomes apart. In contrast, during the closed mitosis of yeast, the nuclear envelope remains intact and the spindle forms inside of the nuclear envelope.  As it elongates to pull the chromosomes apart, the spindle pushes on the nuclear envelope changing its shape from spherical to oblong to dumbbell.  The mechanistic basis for these shape changes remains unknown.  However, with prior NSF support Dr. Sazer has identified and characterized fission yeast mutants in which nuclear size, shape or integrity are compromised.  In collaboration with a group of theoretical physicists her laboratory developed a mathematical model that describes the biophysics of the fission yeast nucleus.   These studies fundamentally changed our understanding of the physical properties of the nuclear envelope and their impact on nuclear division. 	In the project, the principal investigator will test the following hypotheses: 1) Large protein complexes, called spindle pole bodies, which anchor the ends of the spindle in the nuclear envelope, are required to prevent membrane rupture upon spindle elongation; 2) A large influx of new membrane must be added to the nuclear envelope during mitosis and this requires a structural change in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum; and 3) Two newly identified inner nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins influence nuclear structure and organization.  	These studies will answer longstanding questions regarding differences in nuclear structure and function between fungal cells that undergo closed mitosis and animal cells that undergo open mitosis and will have more general applications for understanding how intracellular membrane organization and conformational changes regulate organelle-specific functions.  Broader Impacts      	Graduate students, Rice University undergraduate students and undergraduate participants in the summer SMART (Summer Medical and Research Training) program, which promotes the participation of underrepresented groups in science, will carry out the proposed studies.  	The experimental approaches to be used in this project are particularly well suited to students, who quickly become adept at genetics, cell culture and microscopy and carry out independent projects. In recognition of their intellectual and experimental contributions, nearly 50 of the authors of papers published by the principal investigator were students. All lab members, including undergraduates, participate in lab meetings and journal clubs and present their work at both local and national meetings. The graduate students directly supervise the undergraduates thereby gaining invaluable teaching and managerial experience. 	The principal investigator has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to science education: as a graduate student she lectured in high school biology classes; as a post-doctoral fellow she conducted tutorials for students at Somerville College, the only women's college in the University of Oxford; and, as a faculty member, she mentors an ethnically diverse group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students including a woman who attended a historically black college and several Hispanic women. She is also co-director of the federally funded interdepartmental Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program, participates in graduate curriculum development and has received teaching awards from the Graduate Student Council, the Dean of the Graduate School and the first year graduate student class.

How the stars form, how they generate the energy that powers them, and how they reach their end--sometimes quietly, at other times in cataclysmic explosions--are the questions this field seeks to understand and provide answers to.   The primary aim of the proposed work is to attempt to understand the nuclear reactions that are critical to the energy generation in stars and to the formation of most of the heavy elements that are observed in the Universe. We will use the particle accelerators available in our laboratory, and at laboratories around the world, to investigate specific nuclear reactions that are critical to our understanding of these phenomena, in particular the process of synthesis of heavy elements in the stellar environment. In a holistic approach, we will look at the rate at which certain reactions proceed and the impact these rates have on the generation of higher mass nuclei, measure the atomic masses of the nuclei that are crucial to this process, investigate the theoretical underpinnings of these reactions, and identify avenues of further research. We will also study bulk properties of nuclear matter to better understand the formation of neutron stars and the probability of supernova explosions in the final moments of a star's existence. In a novel approach to these investigations, we will use the techniques of accelerator mass spectrometry (widely known for its use in radiocarbon dating) to identify very rare processes occurring in astrophysical reactions.  Another aspect of this work is to investigate some exotic aspects of the quantal motion of the atomic nuclei. The primary aim of these investigations of the ""structure"" of the atomic nuclei is to understand the fundamental way in which the constituents of the atomic nucleus--the protons and neutrons--interact with each other, and how these interactions lead to the observed nuclear properties. A number of the proposed studies of nuclear structure have direct implications on the astrophysical phenomena the investigation of which constitute the main body of this project.   A very important component of the proposed work is training of young scientists. A large number of graduate students and undergraduate students will be involved with this work, in addition to a few postdoctoral fellows. These young cientists will, in the future years, form the pool of highly-trained personnel, so crucial not only to the continuing leadership of the United States in frontier fields of science and technology, but also to our efforts in defense and homeland security.

The central theme of this proposal is to develop a new method for obtaining a reliable microscopic description of nuclei across the nuclear landscape. This method, which is called the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, has proven very successful in the treatment of many other complex many-body quantum systems, and seems very well suited for application to atomic nuclei as well. The goal of the proposal is to build the Density Matrix Renormalization Group into a practical approach for the microscopic description of atomic nuclei and to apply it systematically across the periodic table.  Success in achieving the goals of this project should have broad impact extending well beyond the nuclear domain. Having a reliable description of the detailed structure of atomic nuclei makes it possible to address fundamental issues in nuclear astrophysics, including how the elements in the universe are synthesized, as well as issues related to fundamental symmetries of nature. The method being developed is computationally very intensive, requiring the development of new computational algorithms that should also have broad application across felds. Finally, the scientific research that is proposed will involve the active participation of several Ph.D. students, helping to train them in forefront scientific research and in cutting edge computational methodologies.

The resulting quark-gluon plasma is believed to exist only in the interior of neutron stars and during the first microsecond after the Big Bang. Since the quark-gluon plasma is only formed for a brief time during the early stage of heavy ion collisions, to verify its existence and to study its properties pose a great challenge both experimentally and theoretically. In this project, we shall develop a multiphase transport model that can describe the interaction between incoming nuclei, the subsequent formation of the quark-gluon plasma, the eventual phase transition back to the hadronic matter, and the final expansion of the hot dense hadronic matter. We will then use the model to find possible signals for the quark-gluon plasma. In particular, we shall investigate if effects due to the quark-gluon plasma can be seen in the collective dynamics of final particles, in the photon and dilepton spectra, and from the abundance of heavy particles that consist of strange and charm quarks.

Experiments are carried out at electron accelerators of intermediate energies. Developments in the last two decades in terms of producing polarized, continuous electron beams and the advent of polarized internal gas targets have introduced a new technique of measurements that fully exploit the spin degrees of freedom. This new technique opens the window to perform definite measurements of fundamental quantities like the charge distribution of the neutron. Precise knowledge of the structure of the neutron at intermediate energies is essential to constrain models of nucleon structure based on the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics. It is also a key ingredient in understanding the nuclear physics of the few-body systems as well as the results derived from other fundamental electron scattering experiments.   The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will train young scientists at the postdoctoral level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the University's technical workforce and that of the society at large.

The physics program supported by this grant is directed at the study of spin and flavor structure of nucleons. Research will be carried out at the DESY laboratory in Germany as part of the HERMES collaboration, and at the Fermi National Laboratory near Chicago as part of the E906 collaboration. The main focus with HERMES will be to determine the contribution of quarks and gluons to the intrinsic angular momentum of the proton and neutron by measuring the scattering of polarized electrons on polarized targets. The program with E906 is focused on Drell/Yan production of di-muon pairs to determine the antiquark distribution in the nucleon sea. In addition, the group will lead the development and operation of the liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets as part of their hardware responsibility for this new effort. As activities on E906 will ramp up, the group's efforts on HERMES will ramp down accordingly.    Education and training of both, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, as well as outreach aimed at the general public is an important aspect of this research program.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Wolfgang, ,Lorenzon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lorenzon@umich.edu                                                              ,2009,437227,

Neutrons and protons move in nuclear  orbitals, which vary with T and I.  Each nucleus has a shape,  which changes as T and I are altered.  Increasing T or I  generates transitions from one nuclear shape to another, for  example, prolate (football), oblate (discus), spherical, etc.  There are also transitions in how the shape is oriented relative  to the rotation axis.  The rotation axis might be parallel to or  perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the shape, or at any  intermediate angle.  A single nucleus may also have transitions  between a normal fluid phase and various kinds of superfluid  phases.  The superfluid phase may contain correlated pairs of two  neutrons, two protons, or one neutron and one proton.  The  internal spins of the two particles in a pair might be parallel  or anti-parallel.  Because atomic nuclei are small systems, they  have large fluctuations in their shape, the orientation of the  shape relative to the rotation axis, and the amount of  superfluidity.

The requested             equipment, when combined with current Physics and Biology Department            instruments, will provide a complete nuclear detection facility.  The           new systems will increase the resolution of the department's                    spectroscopy equipment to the level of present charged particle systems,        thus enabling students to (a) see modern nuclear detection techniques in        introductory physics and radiation biology courses, (b) do meaningful           laboratory experiments at the intermediate through advanced levels, and         (c) do higher quality nuclear physics-related senior thesis projects.           The new equipment will free the present gamma spectroscopy system for           wider use in the introductory and intermediate labs.  It will help              revitalize and expand the use of some current equipment such as a               neutron generator and PDP11/73 minicomputer.

Polarized muons  will be scattered from polarized hydrogen and deuterium targets.  The experiments will be carried out in collaboration with a large  group of US and European researchers, the Spin Muon  Collaboration.  These measurements will help identify the  fraction of the nucleon's spin carried by quarks and gluons, test  fundamental sum-rules related to electroweak interactions, and  probe the strange quark content of the nucleon.  ***",13|0000099,Physics|Other Applications NEC,Ralph,E,Segel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                                                                                ,1994,453334,

A long predicted enhancement  of the longitudinal response relative to the transverse  response, based on fundamental assumptions, has yet to be  observed experimentally.  The measurements will be performed  using the recently installed Indiana University Neutron  Polarimeter Facility (INPOL) at the Indiana University  Cyclotron Facility.  Excitation of the QF peak region in the  light nuclear systems 2H, 3He, and 4He will be measured, and  compared with previously obtained data from the heavier  systems 12C, 40Ca and 208Pb by the same group.  The study of  the light systems allows a comparison to exact Faddeev-type  calculations, which are not possible with the heavier  nuclear systems, which will thus provide insight into the  source of the discrepancy.  Other experiments using INPOL  will provide measurements of low-lying Gamov-Teller Strength  in 40Ar, 59Co, and 127I targets; such information is  essential to properly calibrate measured neutrino fluxes in  proposed solar neutrino measurements.  The Ohio University  group will also take responsibility for the construction of  a neutron time-of flight wall for the BLAST detector at the  MIT-Bates facility and participate in measurements of kaon  electroproduction by the CLAS collaboration at the Thomas  Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.

This project is highly relevant to forefront problems in nuclear physics, such as the physics of nuclei far from stability, where controlled extrapolations away from stability are essential but have been lacking in theoretical approaches to date.  The development of improved calculations with theoretical error bars will be necessary to provide guidance for the next generation of rare isotope beam facilities and reliable nuclear physics input for astrophysical applications.   Our primary tools to accomplish the objectives of this project will be the Renormalization Group, which enables the forces between nucleons to be evolved to a softer form that is more convenient for large-scale computations, and Effective Field Theory, which provides a model-independent and systematic organization of inter-nucleon forces.  This project will have broader impacts by fostering inter-disciplinary connections and helping to build a strong and youthful scientific community in the United States.  The complementary techniques of Effective Field Theory and the Renormalization Group are widely used in many areas of theoretical physics due to their universality and power of simplification.  Therefore, our use of these modern and general techniques will enhance interactions with other disciplines such as condensed matter, atomic, and high energy theory.  Similarly, the use of coupled-cluster and energy density functional methods for nuclei in this work will foster connections with quantum chemistry.  Finally, the current project will provide graduate students and postdocs with a good balance of formal (analytical) and practical (numerical) work, which will serve as excellent preparation for a career in industry or academia.",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Scott,K,Bogner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bogner@nscl.msu.edu                                                             ,2008,81999,

It has been shown that  the nuclear Ras-like GTP-binding protein Ran and its  nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 form a complex that is  critical for a number of nuclear functions, including entry  into and progression of DNA replication, and entry into cell  division.  Mutations in either Ran or RCC1 have complex  phenotypes in animal and yeast cells and affect many  processes, including DNA synthesis and gene expression,  often resulting in cell death.  This project is an  investigation of the functions of Ran and RCC1 in plant cell  division and sexual reproduction.  The proposed studies of  the Ran/RCC1 regulatory complex in a multicellular system  that is amenable to in vivo manipulations should reveal  novel and as yet poorly understood functions for these  conserved proteins.  Preliminary data indicate that plant  Ran is a highly conserved nuclear protein which can suppress  a fission yeast cell cycle mutation.  Ran is encoded by a  family of genes in tomato whose members are differentially  expressed.  The function of Ran and RCC1 in tomato plants  will be investigated using transgenic tomato plants  expressing mutant Ran proteins in an inducible fashion.  This is a novel and powerful tool to investigate the role of  these proteins in development.  In addition, the subcellular  distribution and function of the proteins during cell  division and sexual reproduction are not understood.  Plant  cells present a useful genetic system for such functional  and localization studies.  Together, these experiments  establish an important basis for studies to understand the  function of the Ran/RCC1 regulatory complex in a signal  transduction network that regulates the integration of cell  growth and cell division  %%%  During entry into any phase of  the cell cycle, there are  complex and diverse functions which must be coor dinated. The  phase which leads to initiation of  mitosis, the M phase of  the cell cyle,  requires, and to some degree may be driven  by, multiple activities, some of which involve the Ran gene  product and its associated RCC1 gene product. However, the  work to date on these genes has been done primarily in yeast  and mammalian systems.  This work pulls together the  suggestive  previous work done in yeast and mammalian cell  tissue culture and provides a means to determine definitive  functions of this gene complex through the use of  transgenic technologies in tomato and Arabidopsis plants.  Work has already shown that the genes for Ran/RCC1 in plants  are very similar to those found in yeast and mammals.  The  work also shows that the plant genes can functionally  replace non-functional genes in yeast.  Ending these studies  to plants takes advantage of the multiple known plant  mutations in meiosis, the ""reduction"" division which gives  rise to sexual gametes.  The commonality between the early  phases of mitosis and meiosis would indicate that the  definitive role for these proteins might be uncovered by  exploiting advanced knowledge in this area of plant biology.  Extending the work to plants also takes advantage of the  ""naturally"" occuring cell cycle arrest points and activity  in a mature, differentiated higher plant.  Discovery of the  role of  the Ran/RCC1 regulatory complex in the signal  transduction network involved in the normal development of  plants should provide a deeper of understanding of how these  very basic, common signaling mechanisms are coordinated  during plant, animal and fungal growth.  ***",0000099|61,Other Applications NEC|Life Science Biological,Wilhelm, ,Gruissem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wilhelm.gruissem@ipw.biol.ethz.ch                                               ,1995,183568,

The theories of nuclear systems being developed will be capable of unifying all available data from present and future experiments at facilities including the Continuous Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory(NCSL), the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and the proposed Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA). Among the works are basic studies of nuclear forces, currents, structure and reactions, properties of nuclear matter, and nucleon and hadron structure. A major focus is on understanding new states of matter that are formed under extreme conditions of temperatures and pressures, e.g., quark gluon plasmas formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, including color superconductivity and its consequences. Nuclear processes and properties underly the structure and evolution of stars. The present program applies nuclear theory to neutron stars, nuclear reactions in the cosmos, and supernovae, with the aim of explaining observations and using observations to learn properties of matter under extreme conditions. Research on neutron stars includes the structure of the crust, equation of state and superfluid properties of cold nuclear matter, possible transition to quark matter cores, including droplet and novel superconducting phases. Production, absorption, and scattering rates of neutrinos in hot and dense nuclear matter are studied along with the equation of state and composition.  The strong theoretical connections between nuclear systems and condensed matter systems allow important cross-fertilization between these areas. The condensed matter part of this program continues a long-standing complementary effort to gain theoretical understanding of unusual states of matter. Topics currently being studied include Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetically trapped atomic systems, including states at high rotation, and correlation effects arising from interactions between particles.   Broader Impact  Understanding how nuclear processes and properties govern the evolution of galaxies and the energy generation in stars, including our sun, is an essential step in describing the universe in which we live. The nuclear world operates on length scales a million times smaller than that of the atomic world, and thus provides a deeper view of the structure of matter in the universe. A crucial aspect of this program is to bring out the ways in which underlying interactions between constituents of systems on scales from nuclear to condensed matter to astrophysical govern the system's structure and dynamics. The nuclear and condensed matter systems being studied are very unusual many-body systems that provide unique intellectual insights.  A vital component of this research program is its active tradition of training students and postdoctoral researchers. The group attracts able students and postdocs who, through the broad training they receive and their intimate involvement in the research of the group, develop the ability to combine nuclear, particle, astro and condensed matter physics research on forefront problems. The young scientists trained in this program generally go on to have significant impact in research at universities and  national laboratories.

Beacom's CAREER proposal details plans for using neutrinos and other new messengers to address some of the remaining mysteries of each worldview, and especially the essential questions of their synthesis. The Intellectual Merit of Beacom's proposed scientific work is based on three main directions -- The Supernova Problems, New Messengers, and The Mysterious Neutrino -- which are interwoven with each other and the proposed work in education and public outreach.  Among other goals, the scientific work is designed to help lead to the first detection and subsequent detailed measurements and implications of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background produced by past type-II supernovae, to lead toward a resolution of the uncertain origin of the Milky Way positrons responsible for the observed 0.511 MeV gamma ray emission, to use existing underground detectors and insights from nuclear physics to place novel limits on dark matter, and to develop new tests of neutrino mass models.  The overall focus is strongly oriented towards exploiting the confrontation between laboratory and astrophysical data to derive new insights; applications include how supernovae explode, the cycle of stellar birth and death, the history of nucleosynthesis, and the particle properties of dark matter and neutrinos.  To ensure the Broader Impacts of the proposed work, in addition to Beacom's present efforts on forging interdisciplinary connections and training students and postdocs, he proposes to initiate new efforts to enhance the physics and astronomy education of Deaf (and hard-of-hearing) students.  This would be accomplished by developing materials and activities tailored to the different needs of hearing teachers of Deaf students at mainstream institutions, the Deaf and hearing teachers of Deaf students at institutions primarily using American Sign Language, and Deaf students everywhere.

The Yale-Rochester YRAST gamma-ray detector array, which is coupled to the Yale 20MV tandem accelerator, will be used to complement the proposed research program at Gammasphere. The developments of CHICO, contributions to Gammasphere, and the techniques of Coulomb excitation, heavy-ion induced transfer, and fission-fragment spectroscopy, are the culmination of many years of effort at Rochester. These are used to study collective modes of motion in nuclei, to probe single-particle and pairing degrees of freedom and to explore exotic neutron-rich nuclei far from stability. The research has applications such as the planned studies of exotic metastable (isomeric) states in nuclei may provide a means of using stimulated isomer decay for energy storage or for building gamma-ray lasers. Cline will continue to be involved in the development of the next generation high-resolution gamma-ray detector technology that employs the new concept of tracking the location and energy of every gamma-ray interaction. Such detectors will provide a resolving power that is orders of magnitude better than currently available, enabling studies that at present are inaccessible to nuclear science. Besides having an enormous impact on nuclear science, the potential impact of such gamma-ray tracking and imaging detectors will be considerable to a wide range of applications, including astrophysics, medicine, industry, and nuclear safeguards.

Towards this end, the investigators have identified a novel nuclear protein in Drosophila, Skeletor, which reorganizes from chromosomally associated structure at interphase to a spindle-like structure at metaphase. Double and triple labelings of Skeletor, tubulin, and DNA indicate that the Skeletor spindle may precede the establishment of the microtubule spindle. When this structure is perturbed by anti-Skeletor antibody injection, the investigators observe deterioration of nuclear morphology and a significant decrease in nuclear division. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that there exists a nuclear structure that reorganizes during the cell cycle which plays an essential role in mitotic spindle assembly and/or function yet is distinct from the microtubule spindle. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that embryonic preparations treated briefly with nocodazole and which are void of microtubules still show an intact albeit somewhat deformed Skeletor spindle. The investigators plan to test this hypothesis by performing a number of experiments designed to answer the following key questions: 1) Do anti-Skeletor antibodies identify a previously undescribed nuclear structure? 2) How does this structure reorganize during the cell cycle and does it provide a guide for establishment of the mitotic spindle? 3) Is Skeletor an integral or associated component of this nuclear structure? 4) Does Skeletor function in signaling or effecting the nuclear reorganization events during the cell cycle? 5) What is the effect of perturbing this structure genetically or by other means? 6) What other components interact with or regulate this structure? The information obtained from these experiments will provide major new insights into nuclear architectural remodeling during the cell cycle and microtubule spindle assembly and function during mitosis.

The co-organizers are Professor Aron Bernstein at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor Makoto Oka at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan.  The seminar will focus of two general areas.  The first is on the structure of the nucleon and its interactions with the Goldstone Bosons.  Specific topics include:  1) the deviations of the nucleon and it's first excited state from spherical symmetry as measured in electromagnetic pion production experiments; 2) the polarizabilities of the nucleon as measured in Compton scattering;  3) the question of isospin breaking, caused by the difference of up and down quark masses, in pi N scattering and electromagnetic pion production with polarized targets; and  4) electromagnetic kaon and eta production and scattering from nucleons.  Theoretically these are treated by Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and dynamical meson-exchange models.  The second general area to be discussed is the use of effective field theories for the nucleon-nucleon interactions and for few-nucleon physics.  Here the experimental basis is much further developed although there are still important new measurements, particularly involving spin degrees of freedom and neutron properties, that need to be further explored.    Research topics to be discussed are being actively pursued by theorists and experimentalists in the U.S. and Japan.  In the U.S. there are new electromagnetic apparatus and facilities at Bates, Jefferson Lab and LEGS.  In Japan there are the new Spring-8 photon facility and the Tohuku University electron ring. The project advances international human resources through the participation of a postdoc and graduate student. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.

For collisions of nuclei with very different proton and neutron numbers at current accelerators and planned Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), the relativistic transport model based on the relativistic mean-field model will be extended to include realistic initial nuclear distributions and different mean-field potentials for protons and neutrons, and then used to study the dependence of the energy of nuclear matter on its density and proton to neutron ratio via the two-nucleon correlation functions, the production of light nuclear clusters, the relative diffusion between protons and neutrons, and the ratios of various particles. For ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the strong gluon fields generated in the collisions and the quasi-particle nature of the quarks and gluons will be incorporated in the multiphase transport model that includes both initial interactions among quarks and gluons and final interactions among ordinary hadrons as well as the transition between these two phases of matters. The resulting comprehensive model will be used to study the signatures and properties of the quark-gluon plasma through the collective dynamics of produced particles, the electromagnetic radiations during the collisions, the abundance of particles that consist of heavy quarks, and the energy loss of very energetic particles produced from initial hard collisions. For nuclear reactions induced by photons at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB), effective hadronic models will be used to study the production mechanism and properties of both known and missing baryon resonances.   The project has the intellectual merit of not only impacting directly the research programs at the three major nuclear physics facilities FRIB, RHIC, and JLAB in the U.S. but also contributing to the understanding of many important issues in astro- and particle physics. It also has the broader impact of providing participating young students and postdoctoral researchers a broad research experience that would prepare them well for careers in either nuclear science or other areas to continue their contributions to the scientific and technological advance in our society.

The first two will study nuclei or nuclear reactions that are important to processes in stars that synthesize many of the nuclei of which our universe is comprised.  Both processes involve unusually hot stellar environments, which result in the processes proceeding at very rapid rates.  Thus they can add many protons, in one case, or neutrons, in the other, without undergoing the decays that usually maintain nuclei at or near stability.  Understanding these processes necessitates knowing the properties of, and reactions on, the nuclei through which they pass, so both of these programs focus on short-lived nuclei.  These nuclei can only be produced at radioactive nuclear beam facilities, necessitating our working at accelerator laboratories at Michigan State University, TRIUMF in Canada, or RIKEN in Japan.  A good understanding of the nuclear aspects of the processes by which nuclei are synthesized ultimately allows inversion of the predicted nuclear abundances to understand or constrain the stellar environments in which these processes occur.  Thus these two programs are aimed at understanding both the nucleosynthesis from these processes and the conditions in which the processes operate.  Much of this research will produce data of interest to both nuclear astrophysics and nuclear physics.  The third project is for development of an observatory of neutrinos emitted from a galactic supernova.  While this will ultimately be a much larger effort than could be supported by the present grant, we plan over the next three years to perform the calculations and develop the detectors that will be essential for this observatory.  The neutrinos from a supernova are expected to arrive at earth in several tens of seconds, during which time we should be able to obtain an extraordinary amount of diagnostic information about the process of stellar collapse and the ensuing events that accompany the explosion of a supernova and the collapse of its core to a neutron star or black hole.  It may also be possible to use the data to determine the mass of the most massive neutrinos, information that would be extremely useful to other areas of astrophysics and to particle physics.

The program is introducing undergraduates to research quality activities much sooner than traditionally experienced.  It is producing undergraduates who are valuable to investigators as collaborators rather than merely technicians. One fundamental instrumentation course is being offered for many different disciplines, including physics, health physics, chemistry, geology, and engineering.  This approach is providing the fundamentals necessary for the next semester's advanced course.  The advanced course's structure involves several experimental modules, including high-energy charged particle reactions, nuclear magnetic resonance, XRF, UPS, SEM, STM, reactor approaches to critical experiments, environmental radioactivity analysis, and neutron activation.  Students, along with their advisors, are being given the opportunity to select a fraction of the available modules within a semester period, thereby building a program most suited to their needs.  Through a team teaching approach, students interact directly with researchers with expertise in each area of study.  These classes, emphasizing fundamentals of instrumentation theory, stress scientific technique and communication skills.  To make this happen, the project is establishing four experimental stations primarily applicable to the first course, but available as required in the second course.  The stations include five additional microcomputers, four multichannel analyzer cards, four advanced oscilloscopes, and two printers.  Several NIMs are also being added, including five spectroscopy grade amplifiers, one TAC, and one PNMR spectrometer.  Specialty items, including an instructional STM and two alpha spectroscopy systems, are also being acquired.  This program reduces duplication of advanced laborato ry teaching efforts and intensifies the laboratory experience for undergraduates by providing clear vistas between the fundamentals of technology and current technological applications.  *",0000099,Other Applications NEC,Richard,R,Brey,Gyorgy, ,Vizkelethy,John           ,S,Bennion,Scott          ,S,Hughes,Jeffrey        ,J,Rosentreter,,,,,,,brey@physics.isu.edu                                                            ,1997,367756,
